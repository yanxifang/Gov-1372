This blog contains my work for Government 1372, *Political Psychology*, at Harvard University during Fall 2021. The folder names should be intuitive:

* Individual weekly posts are located in the *_posts* folder.
* The data files that I've used are located in the *data* folder.
* My R scripts are located in the *scripts* folder.
* My graphics can be found in the *images* folder.
