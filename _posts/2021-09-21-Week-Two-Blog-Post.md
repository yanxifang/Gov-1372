## Week 2 Analysis: Human Cooperation
*Tuesday, September 21, 2021*

This week, I am analyzing part of the fundamental reasoning behind human cooperation, building off the work of [Axelrod (2006)](https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/robert-axelrod/the-evolution-of-cooperation/9780465005642/) that was discussed in class to discuss the implications for politics.

### Cooperation and Human Evolution
In his 2006 book, Robert Axelrod describes a theory of cooperation based on the notion that repeated human interaction over time will create incentives for cooperation. Starting with the intuitive idea that self-interested individuals may not necessarily have the incentives to cooperate with each other without a centralized authority compelling such cooperation, Axelrod cites the classic Prisoner's Dilemma game (shown below), where defecting from cooperation can actually yield better results for an individual. However, as Axelrod points out, the Prisoner's Dilemma game can actually be solved, with the most common solution being repeated interactions between players. Axelrod goes on to explain that cooperation, fueled by cooperation and reciprocity, is evolutionarily advantageous, allowing it to become a stable strategy that endures over time.

| C | R = 3, R = 3 | S = 0, T = 5 | 
| D | T = 5, S = 0 | P = 1, P = 1 | 

### Simulating Cooperation
However, the principle of cooperation is not sufficient by itself. Cooperation can take many forms, especially with regard to how individuals respond to defections by the other party (or to continued cooperation); as previously mentioned, unilateral decisions to not cooperate can often prove advantageous for the defecting party. Thus, different people can have different views on what cooperation looks like, leading to different strategies of cooperation (i.e. different sets of rules about when and when not to cooperate). This was a central part of Axelrod's work: he called for many
