## Week 3 Analysis: Groups and Identities
*Tuesday, September 28, 2021*

This week, I examine some of the issues associated with groups and identities, building off the work of [Iyengar and Westwood (2015)](https://pcl.stanford.edu/research/2015/iyengar-ajps-group-polarization.pdf) and [Klar et al. (2018)](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/82/2/379/4996003), both of which focus on how group-oriented behavior is leading to partisanship and polarization in American politics.

### Partisanship and Its Salience
The two-party system of politics has existed in the United States for more than a century now, but yet, the issue of (hyper)partisanship is a relatively new one. How has this become the case in American politics?

As it turns out, the answer is relatively intuitive. Human brains use associative networks to access information quickly, allowing us to assess the characteristics of unknown things by drawing connections/parallels to related things that we do know (this is closely tied to the heuristics that I described in [Week 1](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/2021/09/14/Week-One-Blog-Post.html)). Most Americans know about (or at least, have heard about) political parties, and with the emergence of social media and a 24/7 news cycle over the past decade, political matters are now almost everywhere, making parties particularly useful for categorizing those issues. In turn, **political parties have become more salient within our associative networks**.

But how does salience translate into partisanship? The relationship between these two things is closely tied to evolution: it was evolutionarily advantageous for humans tend to sort themselves into groups, with the idea that acting as a group (and thus sharing the same beliefs/goals as the rest of the group) would increase the likelihood of survival. When political parties (essentially two very large groups, Democrats and Republicans) become prevalent, then people are likely to sort themselves into one, and to see new developments in the world as things they either strong agree or disagree with, based on the party they self-sorted into. This, then, is at the fundamental core of partisanship and polarization: strong (dis)agreements that are difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile.

### Measuring Partisanship
Both Iyengar and Westwood (2015) and Klar et al. (2018) attempt to provide quantitative measures of partisanship and polarization through experimental surveys. The former studied the concept of "affective polarization," which the authors defined as "the tendency of people...to view opposing partisans negatively and copartisans positively," a more formal and exact definition of the phenomenon I described above. They ultimately found, unsurprisingly, that partisans of both parties tended to be biased in favor of their own party -- in both political and non-political situations. Klar et al. (2018) took this even further, applying the test of partisanship to something as personal as marriage, asking respondents about their feelings should their child marry a person from the opposing party. There was again a finding of bias, although with weak partisans (and independents), Klar et al. found some evidence of people just being hesistant about talking about any type of politics whatsoever.

In class, we conducted a parallel version of the Klar et al. experiment. Students were asked two questions: whether they would be happy or unhappy with their child marrying someone from the Democratic Party, and the same question for the Republican Party. There were three randomly-assigned variations of that question: the potential in-law being someone who "rarely" talks about politics, someone who "frequently" talks about politics, and then the baseline (no description about the frequency). The results were then matched with results from an earlier survey that asked about the respondents' political affiliations/beliefs, resulting in the dataset `Sep23ClassData_clean.csv`. 

Using this data, I compared the (un)happiness answers across each of the three randomly-assigned variations of the question, *and* across two separate groups: weak partisans and strong partisans. The results are shown below. (N.B. Strong partisans are respondents who indicate that they identify strongly with either of the two major parties, while everyone else is considered a weak partisan.)

### Analysis
As shown above, **there is a drastic difference between strong and weak partisans.** On the whole, the strong partisans were *very* unhappy about their child marrying someone of the opposite party, and this changed only slightly with the "rarely talks about politics" addition to the question. Meanwhile, weak partisans tended to be less unhappy, with a 50-50 ratio of unhappiness across the three random variations of the question. This shouldn't be too surprising: after all, the stronger connection one feels to their party, the less likely we would expect that person to be accepting of an outsider -- someone with opposing/conflicting values -- for the evolutionary reasons outlined above; the opposite would hold for weak partisans.

Within each group (strong and weak partisans), the findings are also logical. For weak partisans, the "frequently" treatment group had the highest proportion of "unhappy" responses, which makes sense because weak partisans, by definition, care less strongly about politics, and presumably don't want to hear so much about it. Meanwhile, strong partisans had similar proportions of "unhappy" for both the baseline and the "frequently" treatment groups, which also makes intuitive sense because they are expected to care a lot about their own party, regardless of whether they are reminded of that fact (with the "frequently"/"infrequently") or not.

Findings like this, in a class full of politically-engaged students, are troublesome. Although policy debates at the local, state, and national levels are relatively distant compared to the very personal prospect of having an "out-party" in-law, **the fact that there are such strong feelings based solely on one criterion -- party identification -- points to a significant degree of polarization and partisanship.** Assuming that legislators do respond to the desires of the electorate (especially the most vocal and active parts of it, such as people who majored in political science), future gridlock seems almost inevitable, which, in turn, raises questions about the long-term sustainability of truly democratic governance in the US.

Fortunately, there are some caveats to these troubling findings. The strongest one is that most of the American population has a level of political engagement that is far below the level shared by students in a Government course at Harvard. This was shown through the [2020 Cooperative Election Study](https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/), which found that only half of respondents said that they followed politics "most of the time," a figure that is already inflated due to the context that the question gives. In fact, this phenomenon has existed for 50+ years: [Converse (1964)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08913810608443650) found that people were inconsistent between their party and policy preferences, again showing that not much attention is paid to politics. If this is the case, then the hyper-partisanship from the survey would be more related to a hesitancy about discussing politics with family members than a reflection on people's policy preferences.

### Real-World Application
Going from the fundamentals of group identity to people's affiliation with political parties, it is clear that huuman psychology has significant impacts on politics. In the real world, a recent
