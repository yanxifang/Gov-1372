## Week 3 Analysis: Groups and Identities
*Tuesday, September 28, 2021*

This week, I examine some of the issues associated with groups and identities, building off the work of [Iyengar and Westwood (2015)](https://pcl.stanford.edu/research/2015/iyengar-ajps-group-polarization.pdf), which focuses on how group-oreitned behavior is leading to partisanship and polarizatoin in American politics.

### Partisanship and Its Salience
The two-party system of politics has existed in the United States for more than a century now, but yet, the issue of (hyper)partisanship is relatively new and is still emerging today. How has this become the case in American politics?

As it turns out, the answer is relatively intuitive. Human brains use associative networks to access information quickly, allowing us to assess the characteristics of unknown things by drawing connections/parallels to related things that are known (this is closely tied to the heuristics that I described in [Week 1](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/2021/09/14/Week-One-Blog-Post.html)).
