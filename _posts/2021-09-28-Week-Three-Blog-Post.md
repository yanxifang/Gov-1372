## Week 3 Analysis: Groups and Identities
*Tuesday, September 28, 2021*

This week, I examine some of the issues associated with groups and identities, building off the work of [Iyengar and Westwood (2015)](https://pcl.stanford.edu/research/2015/iyengar-ajps-group-polarization.pdf) and [Klar et al. (2018)](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/82/2/379/4996003), both of which focus on how group-oriented behavior is leading to partisanship and polarization in American politics.

### Partisanship and Its Salience
The two-party system of politics has existed in the United States for more than a century now, but yet, the issue of (hyper)partisanship is a relatively new one. How has this become the case in American politics?

As it turns out, the answer is relatively intuitive. Human brains use associative networks to access information quickly, allowing us to assess the characteristics of unknown things by drawing connections/parallels to related things that we do know (this is closely tied to the heuristics that I described in [Week 1](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/2021/09/14/Week-One-Blog-Post.html)). Most Americans know about (or at least, have heard about) political parties, and with the emergence of social media and a 24/7 news cycle over the past decade, political matters are now almost everywhere, making parties particularly useful for categorizing those issues. In turn, **political parties have become more salient within our associative networks**.

But how does salience translate into partisanship? The relationship between these two things is closely tied to evolution: it was evolutionarily advantageous for humans tend to sort themselves into groups, with the idea that acting as a group (and thus sharing the same beliefs/goals as the rest of the group) would increase the likelihood of survival. When political parties (essentially two very large groups, Democrats and Republicans) become prevalent, then people are likely to sort themselves into one, and to see new developments in the world as things they either strong agree or disagree with, based on the party they self-sorted into. This, then, is at the fundamental core of partisanship: strong (dis)agreements that are difficult to reconcile.
