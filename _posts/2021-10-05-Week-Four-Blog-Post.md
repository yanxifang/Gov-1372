## Week 4 Analysis: Hierarchies
*Tuesday, October 5, 2021*

This week, I evaluate the relevance of Social Dominance Theory -- as proposed by [Sidanius and Pratto (1999)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-dominance/ADA29C256881001463D6E2777404DB95) -- to hierarchies and political behavior within the United States.

### Social Dominance Theory and Hierarchies
Now that I've explored the dynamics and politics of [groups](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/2021/09/28/Week-Three-Blog-Post.html), a natural next step is to understand how groups interact with each other -- and how that is manifested in today's society. To answer this question, Sidanius and Pratto (1999) propose using the Social Dominance Theory framework, which essentially states that group-based social hierarchies structure human societies, with hierarchies determined by (a) age, (b) gender, or (c) an arbitrary set of rules, while the ultimate social outcomes are shaped by institutions, which can either enhance or attenuate existing hierarchies.

At the individual level, Sidanius and Pratto further propose a measure called the Social Dominance Orientation, which they define as "the degree to which individuals desire and support group-based hierarchy and the domination of 'inferior' groups by 'superior' groups." Unsurprisingly, they write that individuals vary in their SDO based on how/whether they identiy with salient groups, how they are socialized, and their personality. A person's SDO score is also correlated with various other traits (both inherited and acquired), ranging from gender and race/ethnicity to career preferences. Usually, SDO scores are measured on a 5-point scale, with higher scores representing a more dominant personality and lower scores representing a less dominant personality.

**This is relevant to politics because throughout history, and particularly throughout American history, various racial and socioeconomic groups have dominated society,** making it essential to understand how inter-group dynamics work if a more egalitarian society is to be achieved. So, how exactly does the idea of domination play out in the U.S. today?

### Measuring Social Dominance
Typically, we are most interested in how "socially dominant" individuals are, because some of the most important political decisions, particularly voting (both by the general public and by members of legislatures), are made at the individual level. To actually measure this, a series of 16 statements are shown to correspondents with the goal of understanding their attitudes, not only in terms of dominance, but also in terms of egalitarianism. These statements include things like "groups at the bottom should not have to stay in their place" and "we should do what we can to equalize conditions for different groups."

To conduct my analysis this week, I used the dataset made available to the entire class (`sdo_data.csv`), which consisted of condensed results from a 2018 survey of U.S. voters conducted by Data for Progress, a progressive, left-wing think tank. Among other things, the survey measured SDO scores, demographic information, political information (e.g. party membership, 2016 presidential vote, ideological leanings), respondents' attitudes toward the following: Trump, the Black Lives Matter movement, the MeToo movement, the prospect of demographic change, and the symbolism of the Confederate flag. While this survey is not perfect (after all, it was conducted by a left-leaning group, and likely in pursuit of progressive causes), it still provides room for analysis.

### Social Dominance and Political Outcomes
The first thing I evaluated was the relationship between SDO scores and party affiliation. Under Social Dominance Theory, Democrats (who are left-leaning and on average, are much more supportive of inequality-combatting policies than Republicans might be) are expected to have lower SDO scores (i.e. less dominant personalities). **I can observe this trend in the survey data:** as the histogram below shows, respondents who identified themselves as Democrats turned out to have lower SDO scores on average, while respondents who identified themselves as Independents or Republicans had higher SDO scores on average (which would be indicative of higher levels of dominance -- i.e. greater support for the hierarchical status quo). With the relatively large sample size (`N = 3144`) of the survey, this leads me to be reasonably confident in the notion that at least some part of the Social Dominance Theory is correct -- that is, assuming that the 16-statement survey is an accurate gauge of people's true societal attitudes.

Another political outcome of interest would be how individuals voted in important elections, such as the 2016 U.S. presidential election. To analyze this, I ran two regressions to model the relationship between a voter's choice in the 2016 election (the outcome variable) and that voter's characteristics, which included their social dominance score,  gender (female or non-female), race (white or non-white), education (on a 1-6 scale: 1 representing someone without a high school diploma and 6 representing someone with a postgraduate degree), age, 3-category party identification (1: Democrat, 2: Independent, 3: Repubilcan), and 5-category political ideology (1 being very liberal to 5 being very conservative). The results are displayed in the table below:

The first model (the numbers on the left) was a linear one, while the second was a logistic one. In both cases, a positive coefficient would represent a higher likelihood of voting for Trump, since the outcome variable was coded with 0 being a non-Trump vote and 1 being a Trump vote. Going to each variable, the coefficients mean the following (note that this is all *on average* and everything is a *prediction*):

- `sdo5`: In both cases, a higher SDO score (meaning a more dominant / hierarchy-accepting personality) is associated with a higher likelihood of voting for Trump. Both coefficients are positive and statistically significant.
- `female`: In both cases, the coefficients are not statistically significant, meaning that it is unclear whether being female (coded as a `1`, with non-females coded as a `0`) leads to a higher or lower likelihood of voting for Trump (or no change in the likelihood).
- `white`: In the linear model, the coefficient shows that being white (coded as a `1`, with non-whites coded as a `0`) leads to a higher likelihood of voting for Trump, while the logistic model has a coefficient that is not significant (so can't be interpreted).
- `educ`: In both models, obtaining higher levels of education is associated with a lower likelihood of voting for Trump. Both coefficients are negative and statistically significant.
- `age`: In both models, being older is associated with a higher likelihood of voting for Trump. Both coefficients are positive and statistically significant, although quite small in magnitude compared to the other coefficients.
- `pid3` and `ideo5`: For both of these variables, identifying as an independent or Republican (or more conservative) is associated with a higher likelihood of voting for Trump. All four coefficients are positive and statistically significant.

**The important takeaway here is that individuals with higher SDO scores -- representing those who are more accepting of existing social group hierarchies -- were predicted, on average, to be more likely to vote for Trump, the Republican nominee, during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.** This is consistent with Social Dominance Theory: the Republican Party, as it stands today, is consistently less open to wholesale social and economic change than the Democratic Party, so it would make sense that people who are more amenable to the status quo (as measured by SDO) would vote for the Trump, the candidate representing the Republican Party.

### Implications for Policy and Social Change
It is clear that Democrats, Independents, and Republicans have different SDO scores on average, with the former having lower scores that demonstrate their pro-equality attitudes. These attitudes extend to institutions, which, as previously mentioned, can be seen as either hierarchy-enforcing (i.e. helping to maintain the unequal, hierarchical status quo between different groups) or hierarchy-attenuating (i.e. helping to reduce the inequality between groups). Thus, there is a significant potential for diverging attitudes -- attitudes that may not necessarily be reconcilable between the two sides of the political aisle.

This was recently seen with police (as an institution): at least [one study](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/18/e2007693118) has found that white officers with higher SDO scores tend to use force more frequently, so unsurprisingly (and especially after the racial justice protests last year), many Democrats tend to see the institution of police as hierarchy-enforcing and thus [unable to reform itself](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html) -- and by extension, as something that must be removed from the U.S. governmental structure in order to promote a more egalitarian society.
