## Week 4 Analysis: Hierarchies
*Tuesday, October 5, 2021*

This week, I evaluate the relevance of Social Dominance Theory -- as proposed by [Sidanius and Pratto (1999)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-dominance/ADA29C256881001463D6E2777404DB95) -- to hierarchies and political behavior within the United States.

At the individual level, Sidanius and Pratto further propose a measure called the Social Dominance Orientation, which they define as "the degree to which individuals desire and support group-based hierarchy and the domination of 'inferior' groups by 'superior' groups." Unsurprisingly, they write that individuals vary in their SDO based on how/whether they identiy with salient groups, how they are socialized, and their personality. A person's SDO score is also correlated with various other social traits, such as gender, race/ethnicity, and more.

But how does this relate to politics? Obviously, the t
