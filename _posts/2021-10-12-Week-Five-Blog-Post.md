## Week 5 Analysis: Personality and Worldview
*Tuesday, October 12, 2021*

This week, I take a closer look at the concept of using measures of individuals' personalities to predict their political ideology. This builds upon the work of [Carney et al. (2009)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20447169), as well as [Hetherington and Weiler (2015)](https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/prius-or-pickup/9781328866783), both of which we read in class, and both of which explore the relationship between various measures of personality and individual-level political preferences and beliefs.

### Measuring Personality and Worldview
Before trying to establish a link (much less a causal relationship) between personality and political ideology, it is necessary to first identify what these terms really refer to, and then figure out how one might go about measuring them consistently -- and accurately -- across large groups of people. 

Generally speaking, **the term "worldview" (interchangeable with ideology) refers to a person's cognitive orientation toward society,** or, in other words, the defining thing that guides a person's social behavior. Conceptually, this might be broken down into several diametrically-opposed models: individuals with left-leaning worldviews might be more open, more supportive of equality and change, and perceive the world as less dangerous, while individuals with right-leaning worldviews might be more closed, more supportive of hierarchy and tradition, and perceive the world as more dangerous. There is some empirical support for these models -- for instance, conservatives were more likely to.

Although such models shed some light about the dimension(s) that we want to find out more about, it's not exactly clear how we might measure individuals. To solve this, Hetherington and Weiler propose operationalizing these dimensions with survey questions that ask about social conformity, specifically in the context of one's expectations about the behavioral characteristics of children. For instance, "independence" is pitted against "respect for elders", while "being considerate" is pitted against "being well behaved", and respondents have to chosose the characteristic that they believe to be more important. As an alternative, Carney et al. (as well as many other psychologists) propose using the "Big Five" framework of personality, which typically uses a long list of questions to gather information about how open people are to new experiences, how conscientious people are (i.e. being in control of their environment), etc. In both cases, the results would then be translated into some quantified value of an individual's worldview.

The logical next step is to measure political ideology. This is much more commonly done, since pollsters typically ask about individuals' party affiliation or political beliefs/identity as part of the process of gauging the extent of a candidate's political support from various groups in society. Thus, it makes sense to just ask survey respondents where they fall on a numerical liberal-to-conservative scale, and as an added bonus, Carney et al. also add in two additional measures for greater precision, asking where respondents fall on a liberal-to-conservative scale on social issues verus on economic issues, the two main sub-categories of left-right politics.

### Linking Concepts to Empirical Evidence
Now that some practical methods of measuring personality and worldview have been proposed, the next step is quite clear: using regressions to examine the numerical relationship between the personality measures/data (the explanatory/independent variable) and the worldview measures/data (the outcome/dependent variable). Both of the cited works do just this: Hetherington and Weller use ANES (American National Election Survey) data -- specifically, the data on social attitudes -- to evaluate the differences in political preferences between "fixed" (more conservative) and "fluid" (more liberal) people, while Carney et al. use experimental/survey data about the Big Five. **Despite the very different approaches, both come to similar conclusions: that conservatives are less open to change and more supportive of the status quo.** (This is manifested by lower openness, higher conscientiousness, and lower support for changing societal attitudes among conservatives.)

To see how this relationship plays out, I use the data collected in class (`Oct7ClassData.csv`), which was collected with a survey/experimental structure that paralleled two of the three methods used by Carney et al. The first method is simply the personality surveys: modified versions of the Big Five Inventory (BFI) and the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) were given out, and scores calculated from each inventory for each of the Big Five dimensions (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness). As strange as it may sound, the second method makes the assumption that behavioral contexts have physical manifestations, particularly with spaces that are often used by a person -- this makes some intuitive sense, because for instance, a person will naturally want to structure their room in a way that best fits their preferences. From these physical characteristics, such as the amount and type of room decorations, we might be able to infer, for instance, how open a person is to new things (which would be used as a measure of openness). Then, obviously, the outcome/dependent variable (political ideology) was measured in the standard way of asking for a self-score on a scale of 1 to 5, with the lower end representing someone who is "extremely liberal"; this was done for a person's overall political orientation, as well as for specific orientations in the social and economic fields, respectively (as discussed above).

### Results & Discussion
Interestingly, the results were quite inconclusive and did not match up with what Carney et al. found. While they concluded that liberals score more highly on Openness than conservatives, and that conservatives score more highly on some sub-elements of Conscientiousness, **I found no statistically significant relationships whatsoever.** After running a series of multivariate linear regressions, with the Big Five dimensions (representing personality) as the explanatory variables and the political orientation (a proxy for worldview) as the outcome/dependent variable, I got the following results:

![OLS Regressions on Personality and Worldview](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/images/ols_regressions_personality_worldview.png)

As shown above, none of the estimated coefficients are statistically significant, even if we assume a rather lax `alpha = 0.10` significance level. This means that **we cannot rule out the possibility that none of the explanatory variables (i.e. none of the Big Five indicators of personality) actually have any impact on the outcome variable, a person's worldview,** since the lack of statistical significance means that the true coefficients might actually be zero. In fact, as shown above, the adjusted R-squared values for each of the three regressions (one for general political worldview, one for economic political worldview, and one for social political worldview) are actually negative, suggesting that the fitted models are worse than a horizontal line (which is the fourth model) for explaining the observed data.

However, running a linear regression with a discrete and categorical outcome variable can be problematic, because linear regression requires making an assumption that the true relationship between the explanatory variables and the outcome variable is linear -- and thus continuous. Thus, I experimented with a different model specification: I converted the general political worldview variable into a 0-or-1 binary variable, with two different coding methods (one labelling all `1`s and `2`s as liberals, and `3`s, `4`s, and `5`s as conservatives, while the other one differs by labeling `3`s as either liberal or conservative depending on the person's combined social and economic ideology scores). Now, the outcome variable, worldview, is binary, so I can run a logistic regression. The results are printed below in the first two columns; for greater transparency, I also included the corresponding linear reressions even though the linearity assumptions would clearly be violated.

As shown above, **even when I choose a different approach to coding the outcome variable, none of the Big Five indicators of personality have any impact on worldview**. The lack of statistical significance is interpreted the same way as before: that we can't discount the possibility that the true coefficients are actually zero and thus do not offer any explanatory value in the model.

There are some issues to consider here:
- *The political orientation of Harvard students.*
- *The sample size.*



Another political outcome of interest would be how individuals voted in important elections, such as the 2016 U.S. presidential election. To analyze this, I ran two regressions to model the relationship between a voter's choice in the 2016 election (the outcome variable) and that voter's characteristics, which included their social dominance score,  gender (female or non-female), race (white or non-white), education (on a 1-6 scale: 1 representing someone without a high school diploma and 6 representing someone with a postgraduate degree), age, 3-category party identification (1: Democrat, 2: Independent, 3: Repubilcan), and 5-category political ideology (1 being very liberal to 5 being very conservative). The results are displayed in the table below:

The first model (the numbers on the left) was a linear one, while the second was a logistic one. In both cases, a positive coefficient would represent a higher likelihood of voting for Trump, since the outcome variable was coded with 0 being a non-Trump vote and 1 being a Trump vote. Going to each variable, the coefficients mean the following (note that this is all *on average* and everything is a *prediction*):

- `sdo5`: In both cases, a higher SDO score (meaning a more dominant / hierarchy-accepting personality) is associated with a higher likelihood of voting for Trump. Both coefficients are positive and statistically significant.
- `female`: In both cases, the coefficients are not statistically significant, meaning that it is unclear whether being female (coded as a `1`, with non-females coded as a `0`) leads to a higher or lower likelihood of voting for Trump (or no change in the likelihood).
- `white`: In the linear model, the coefficient shows that being white (coded as a `1`, with non-whites coded as a `0`) leads to a higher likelihood of voting for Trump, while the logistic model has a coefficient that is not significant (so can't be interpreted).
- `educ`: In both models, obtaining higher levels of education is associated with a lower likelihood of voting for Trump. Both coefficients are negative and statistically significant.
- `age`: In both models, being older is associated with a higher likelihood of voting for Trump. Both coefficients are positive and statistically significant, although quite small in magnitude compared to the other coefficients.
- `pid3` and `ideo5`: For both of these variables, identifying as an independent or Republican (or more conservative) is associated with a higher likelihood of voting for Trump. All four coefficients are positive and statistically significant.

**The important takeaway here is that individuals with higher SDO scores -- representing those who are more accepting of existing social group hierarchies -- were predicted, on average, to be more likely to vote for Trump, the Republican nominee, during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.** This is consistent with Social Dominance Theory: the Republican Party, as it stands today, is consistently less open to wholesale social and economic change than the Democratic Party, so it would make sense that people who are more amenable to the status quo (as measured by SDO) would vote for the Trump, the candidate representing the Republican Party.

### Concerns About Accuracy
It is clear that Democrats, Independents, and Republicans have different SDO scores on average, with the former having lower scores that demonstrate their pro-equality attitudes. These attitudes extend to institutions, which, as previously mentioned, can be seen as either hierarchy-enforcing (i.e. helping to maintain the unequal, hierarchical status quo between different groups) or hierarchy-attenuating (i.e. helping to reduce the inequality between groups). Thus, there is a significant potential for diverging attitudes -- attitudes that may not necessarily be reconcilable between the two sides of the political aisle.

This was recently seen with police (as an institution): at least [one study](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/18/e2007693118) has found that white officers with higher SDO scores tend to use force more frequently, so unsurprisingly (and especially after the racial justice protests last year), many Democrats tend to see the institution of police as hierarchy-enforcing and thus [unable to reform itself](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html) -- and by extension, as something that must be removed from the U.S. governmental structure in order to promote a more egalitarian society. On the opposite end, Republicans tend to only oppose the most extreme cases of police misuse of force, and are in favor of keeping police with the rationale that it is an institution essential to public safety. While compromises can generally be made in the policy arena to obtain practical and bipartisan outcomes, they are hard to achieve when there is such diametrical opposition between the two views. This example shows the overwhelming power of Social Dominance Theory to explain the ongoing American political dysfunction: **as more institutions and policies get linked to opposite ends of the SDO spectrum, greater disagreement will arise**, to the point that soon, differences may diverge so much that it may no longer be possible to negotiate in good faith.
