## Week 5 Analysis: Personality and Worldview
*Tuesday, October 12, 2021*

This week, I take a closer look at the concept of using measures of individuals' personalities to predict their political ideology. This builds upon the work of [Carney et al. (2009)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20447169), as well as [Hetherington and Weiler (2015)](https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/prius-or-pickup/9781328866783), both of which we read in class, and both of which explore the relationship between various measures of personality and individual-level political preferences and beliefs.

### Measuring Personality and Worldview
Before trying to establish a link (much less a causal relationship) between personality and political ideology, it is necessary to first identify what these terms really refer to, and then figure out how one might go about measuring them consistently -- and accurately -- across large groups of people. 

Generally speaking, **the term "worldview" (interchangeable with ideology) refers to a person's cognitive orientation toward society,** or, in other words, the defining thing that guides a person's social behavior. Conceptually, this might be broken down into several diametrically-opposed models: individuals with left-leaning worldviews might be more open, more supportive of equality and change, and perceive the world as less dangerous, while individuals with right-leaning worldviews might be more closed, more supportive of hierarchy and tradition, and perceive the world as more dangerous. There is some empirical support for these models -- for instance, conservatives were more likely to.

Although such models shed some light about the dimension(s) that we want to find out more about, it's not exactly clear how we might measure individuals. To solve this, Hetherington and Weiler propose operationalizing these dimensions with survey questions that ask about social conformity, specifically in the context of one's expectations about the behavioral characteristics of children. For instance, "independence" is pitted against "respect for elders", while "being considerate" is pitted against "being well behaved", and respondents have to chosose the characteristic that they believe to be more important. As an alternative, Carney et al. (as well as many other psychologists) propose using the "Big Five" framework of personality, which typically uses a long list of questions to gather information about how open people are to new experiences, how conscientious people are (i.e. being in control of their environment), etc. In both cases, the results would then be translated into some quantified value of an individual's worldview.

The logical next step is to measure political ideology. This is much more commonly done, since pollsters typically ask about individuals' party affiliation or political beliefs/identity as part of the process of gauging the extent of a candidate's political support from various groups in society. Thus, it makes sense to just ask survey respondents where they fall on a numerical liberal-to-conservative scale, and as an added bonus, Carney et al. also add in two additional measures for greater precision, asking where respondents fall on a liberal-to-conservative scale on social issues verus on economic issues, the two main sub-categories of left-right politics.

### Linking Concepts to Empirical Evidence
Now that some practical methods of measuring personality and worldview have been proposed, the next step is quite clear: using regressions to examine the numerical relationship between the personality measures/data (the explanatory/independent variable) and the worldview measures/data (the outcome/dependent variable). Both of the cited works do just this: Hetherington and Weller use ANES (American Natioanl Election Survey) data -- specifically, the data on social attitudes -- to evaluate the differences in political preferences between "fixed" (more conservative) and "fluid" (more liberal) people, while Carney et al. use experimental/survey data about the Big Five. **Despite the very different approaches, both come to similar conclusions: that conservatives are less open to change and more supportive of the status quo.** (This is manifested by lower openness, higher conscientiousness, and lower support for changing societal attitudes among conservatives.)

To see how this relationship plays out, I use the data collected in class (`Oct7ClassData.csv`), which was collected with a survey/experimental structure that paralleled two of the three methods used by Carney et al. The first method is simply the personality surveys: As strange as it may sound, the second method makes the assumption that behavioral contexts have physical manifestations, particularly with spaces that are often used by a person -- this makes some intuitive sense, because for instance, a person will naturally want to structure their room in a way that best fits their preferences. From these physical characteristics, such as the amount and type of room decorations, we might be able to infer how open a person is to new things (which is part of the Big Five elements of personality).


**This is relevant to politics because throughout history, and particularly throughout American history, various racial and socioeconomic groups have dominated society,** making it essential to understand how inter-group dynamics work if a more egalitarian society is to be achieved. So, how exactly does the idea of domination play out in the U.S. today?

### Measuring Social Dominance
Typically, we are most interested in how "socially dominant" individuals are, because some of the most important political decisions, particularly voting (both by the general public and by members of legislatures), are made at the individual level. To actually measure this, a series of 16 statements are shown to correspondents with the goal of understanding their attitudes, not only in terms of dominance, but also in terms of egalitarianism. These statements include things like "groups at the bottom should not have to stay in their place" and "we should do what we can to equalize conditions for different groups."

To conduct my analysis this week, I used the dataset made available to the entire class (`sdo_data.csv`), which consisted of condensed results from a 2018 survey of U.S. voters conducted by Data for Progress, a progressive, left-wing think tank. Among other things, the survey measured SDO scores, demographic information, political information (e.g. party membership, 2016 presidential vote, ideological leanings), respondents' attitudes toward the following: Trump, the Black Lives Matter movement, the MeToo movement, the prospect of demographic change, and the symbolism of the Confederate flag. While this survey is not perfect (after all, it was conducted by a left-leaning group, and likely in pursuit of progressive causes), it still provides room for analysis.

### Social Dominance and Political Outcomes
The first thing I evaluated was the relationship between SDO scores and party affiliation. Under Social Dominance Theory, Democrats (who are left-leaning and on average, are much more supportive of inequality-combatting policies than Republicans might be) are expected to have lower SDO scores (i.e. less dominant personalities). **I can observe this trend in the survey data:** as the histogram below shows, respondents who identified themselves as Democrats turned out to have lower SDO scores on average, while respondents who identified themselves as Independents or Republicans had higher SDO scores on average (which would be indicative of higher levels of dominance -- i.e. greater support for the hierarchical status quo). With the relatively large sample size (`N = 3144`) of the survey, this leads me to be reasonably confident in the notion that at least some part of the Social Dominance Theory is correct -- that is, assuming that the 16-statement survey is an accurate gauge of people's true societal attitudes.

Another political outcome of interest would be how individuals voted in important elections, such as the 2016 U.S. presidential election. To analyze this, I ran two regressions to model the relationship between a voter's choice in the 2016 election (the outcome variable) and that voter's characteristics, which included their social dominance score,  gender (female or non-female), race (white or non-white), education (on a 1-6 scale: 1 representing someone without a high school diploma and 6 representing someone with a postgraduate degree), age, 3-category party identification (1: Democrat, 2: Independent, 3: Repubilcan), and 5-category political ideology (1 being very liberal to 5 being very conservative). The results are displayed in the table below:

The first model (the numbers on the left) was a linear one, while the second was a logistic one. In both cases, a positive coefficient would represent a higher likelihood of voting for Trump, since the outcome variable was coded with 0 being a non-Trump vote and 1 being a Trump vote. Going to each variable, the coefficients mean the following (note that this is all *on average* and everything is a *prediction*):

- `sdo5`: In both cases, a higher SDO score (meaning a more dominant / hierarchy-accepting personality) is associated with a higher likelihood of voting for Trump. Both coefficients are positive and statistically significant.
- `female`: In both cases, the coefficients are not statistically significant, meaning that it is unclear whether being female (coded as a `1`, with non-females coded as a `0`) leads to a higher or lower likelihood of voting for Trump (or no change in the likelihood).
- `white`: In the linear model, the coefficient shows that being white (coded as a `1`, with non-whites coded as a `0`) leads to a higher likelihood of voting for Trump, while the logistic model has a coefficient that is not significant (so can't be interpreted).
- `educ`: In both models, obtaining higher levels of education is associated with a lower likelihood of voting for Trump. Both coefficients are negative and statistically significant.
- `age`: In both models, being older is associated with a higher likelihood of voting for Trump. Both coefficients are positive and statistically significant, although quite small in magnitude compared to the other coefficients.
- `pid3` and `ideo5`: For both of these variables, identifying as an independent or Republican (or more conservative) is associated with a higher likelihood of voting for Trump. All four coefficients are positive and statistically significant.

**The important takeaway here is that individuals with higher SDO scores -- representing those who are more accepting of existing social group hierarchies -- were predicted, on average, to be more likely to vote for Trump, the Republican nominee, during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.** This is consistent with Social Dominance Theory: the Republican Party, as it stands today, is consistently less open to wholesale social and economic change than the Democratic Party, so it would make sense that people who are more amenable to the status quo (as measured by SDO) would vote for the Trump, the candidate representing the Republican Party.

### Concerns About Accuracy
It is clear that Democrats, Independents, and Republicans have different SDO scores on average, with the former having lower scores that demonstrate their pro-equality attitudes. These attitudes extend to institutions, which, as previously mentioned, can be seen as either hierarchy-enforcing (i.e. helping to maintain the unequal, hierarchical status quo between different groups) or hierarchy-attenuating (i.e. helping to reduce the inequality between groups). Thus, there is a significant potential for diverging attitudes -- attitudes that may not necessarily be reconcilable between the two sides of the political aisle.

This was recently seen with police (as an institution): at least [one study](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/18/e2007693118) has found that white officers with higher SDO scores tend to use force more frequently, so unsurprisingly (and especially after the racial justice protests last year), many Democrats tend to see the institution of police as hierarchy-enforcing and thus [unable to reform itself](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html) -- and by extension, as something that must be removed from the U.S. governmental structure in order to promote a more egalitarian society. On the opposite end, Republicans tend to only oppose the most extreme cases of police misuse of force, and are in favor of keeping police with the rationale that it is an institution essential to public safety. While compromises can generally be made in the policy arena to obtain practical and bipartisan outcomes, they are hard to achieve when there is such diametrical opposition between the two views. This example shows the overwhelming power of Social Dominance Theory to explain the ongoing American political dysfunction: **as more institutions and policies get linked to opposite ends of the SDO spectrum, greater disagreement will arise**, to the point that soon, differences may diverge so much that it may no longer be possible to negotiate in good faith.
