## Week 5 Analysis: Personality and Worldview
*Tuesday, October 12, 2021*

This week, I take a closer look at the concept of using measures of individuals' personalities to predict their political ideology. This builds upon the work of [Carney et al. (2009)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20447169), as well as [Hetherington and Weiler (2015)](https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/prius-or-pickup/9781328866783), both of which we read in class, and both of which explore the relationship between various measures of personality and individual-level political preferences and beliefs.

### Measuring Personality and Worldview
Before trying to establish a link (much less a causal relationship) between personality and political ideology, it is necessary to first identify what these terms really refer to, and then figure out how one might go about measuring them consistently -- and accurately -- across large groups of people. 

Generally speaking, **the term "worldview" (interchangeable with ideology) refers to a person's cognitive orientation toward society,** or, in other words, the defining thing that guides a person's social behavior. Conceptually, this might be broken down into several diametrically-opposed models: individuals with left-leaning worldviews might be more open, more supportive of equality and change, and perceive the world as less dangerous, while individuals with right-leaning worldviews might be more closed, more supportive of hierarchy and tradition, and perceive the world as more dangerous. There is some empirical support for these models -- for instance, conservatives were more likely to.

Although such models shed some light about the dimension(s) that we want to find out more about, it's not exactly clear how we might measure individuals. To solve this, Hetherington and Weiler propose operationalizing these dimensions with survey questions that ask about social conformity, specifically in the context of one's expectations about the behavioral characteristics of children. For instance, "independence" is pitted against "respect for elders", while "being considerate" is pitted against "being well behaved", and respondents have to chosose the characteristic that they believe to be more important. As an alternative, Carney et al. (as well as many other psychologists) propose using the "Big Five" framework of personality, which typically uses a long list of questions to gather information about how open people are to new experiences, how conscientious people are (i.e. being in control of their environment), etc. In both cases, the results would then be translated into some quantified value of an individual's worldview.

The logical next step is to measure political ideology. This is much more commonly done, since pollsters typically ask about individuals' party affiliation or political beliefs/identity as part of the process of gauging the extent of a candidate's political support from various groups in society. Thus, it makes sense to just ask survey respondents where they fall on a numerical liberal-to-conservative scale, and as an added bonus, Carney et al. also add in two additional measures for greater precision, asking where respondents fall on a liberal-to-conservative scale on social issues verus on economic issues, the two main sub-categories of left-right politics.

### Linking Concepts to Empirical Evidence
Now that some practical methods of measuring personality and worldview have been proposed, the next step is quite clear: using regressions to examine the numerical relationship between the personality measures/data (the explanatory/independent variable) and the worldview measures/data (the outcome/dependent variable). Both of the cited works do just this: Hetherington and Weller use ANES (American National Election Survey) data -- specifically, the data on social attitudes -- to evaluate the differences in political preferences between "fixed" (more conservative) and "fluid" (more liberal) people, while Carney et al. use experimental/survey data about the Big Five. **Despite the very different approaches, both come to similar conclusions: that conservatives are less open to change and more supportive of the status quo.** (This is manifested by lower openness, higher conscientiousness, and lower support for changing societal attitudes among conservatives.)

To see how this relationship plays out, I use the data collected in class (`Oct7ClassData.csv`), which was collected with a survey/experimental structure that paralleled two of the three methods used by Carney et al. The first method is simply the personality surveys: modified versions of the Big Five Inventory (BFI) and the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) were given out, and scores calculated from each inventory for each of the Big Five dimensions (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness). As strange as it may sound, the second method makes the assumption that behavioral contexts have physical manifestations, particularly with spaces that are often used by a person -- this makes some intuitive sense, because for instance, a person will naturally want to structure their room in a way that best fits their preferences. From these physical characteristics, such as the amount and type of room decorations, we might be able to infer, for instance, how open a person is to new things (which would be used as a measure of openness). Then, obviously, the outcome/dependent variable (political ideology) was measured in the standard way of asking for a self-score on a scale of 1 to 5, with the lower end representing someone who is "extremely liberal"; this was done for a person's overall political orientation, as well as for specific orientations in the social and economic fields, respectively (as discussed above).

### Class Results & Discussion
Interestingly, the results were quite inconclusive and did not match up with what Carney et al. found. While they concluded that liberals score more highly on Openness than conservatives, and that conservatives score more highly on some sub-elements of Conscientiousness, **I found no statistically significant relationships whatsoever.** After running a series of multivariate linear regressions, with the Big Five dimensions (representing personality) as the explanatory variables and the political orientation (a proxy for worldview) as the outcome/dependent variable, I got the following results:

![OLS Regressions on Personality and Worldview](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/images/ols_regressions_personality_worldview.PNG)

As shown above, none of the estimated coefficients are statistically significant, even if we assume a rather lax `alpha = 0.10` significance level. This means that **we cannot rule out the possibility that none of the explanatory variables (i.e. none of the Big Five indicators of personality) actually have any impact on the outcome variable, a person's worldview,** since the lack of statistical significance means that the true coefficients might actually be zero. In fact, as shown above, the adjusted R-squared values for each of the three regressions (one for general political worldview, one for economic political worldview, and one for social political worldview) are actually negative, suggesting that the fitted models are worse than a horizontal line (which is the fourth model) for explaining the observed data.

However, running a linear regression with a discrete and categorical outcome variable can be problematic, because linear regression requires making an assumption that the true relationship between the explanatory variables and the outcome variable is linear -- and thus continuous. Thus, I experimented with a different model specification: I converted the general political worldview variable into a 0-or-1 binary variable, with two different coding methods (one labelling all `1`s and `2`s as liberals, and `3`s, `4`s, and `5`s as conservatives, while the other one differs by labeling `3`s as either liberal or conservative depending on the person's combined social and economic ideology scores). Now, the outcome variable, worldview, is binary, so I can run a logistic regression. The results are printed below in the first two columns; for greater transparency, I also included the corresponding linear reressions even though the linearity assumptions would clearly be violated.

As shown above, **even when I choose a different approach to coding the outcome variable, none of the Big Five indicators of personality have any impact on worldview**. The lack of statistical significance is interpreted the same way as before: that we can't discount the possibility that the true coefficients are actually zero and thus do not offer any explanatory value in the model.

### Concerns About Accuracy
While the class survey -- and the resulting data analysis -- was a fascinating way to experience and learn about how (political) psychologists try to explain real-world phenomena like partisanship and ideological divisions, there are many caveats to the results that I found (or rather, didn't find, since my conclusion was the absence of a relationship between personality and worldview).

First, **the samples in both the original study and our in-class study are not representative of the American population.** While academic studies understandably use university students for experiments for simplicity and practicality's sake, it is critical to remember that because the majority of Americans do not have a college degree, even the least politically-engaged student represents someone who is expected to know more about politics than the average American. In the Harvard case, the un-representativeness of the sample is even more problematic due to the lack of conservatives; to highlight the extent of this issue, an example is that in one of my binary coding approaches, I ended up with only four observations (out of approximately 80) that were considered to be conservative. Thus, it would not be reasonable to extrapolate findings (if any) to the general American population.

Second, **there are many ways to measure both personality and political attitudes.** The two studies we read in class were just a small part of the available literature on this topic, and presumably, other authors use different approaches to measuring both the explanatory and outcome variables, which inevitably leads to different results and different implications for the real, political world. Even for authors who use similar/identical approaches with the idea of replicating existing findings, the results may be different beacuse the sub-set of people were different. This leads, then, to questions about how valid the class data is for drawing conclusions from.

Finally, **while there are definite differences in personality, it is unclear how much that translates into the political realm.** As discussed briefly in previous weeks, many Americans simply don't care (or know) much about politics, so as a political science student, it is sometimes difficult to come to terms with the fact that our assumptions about everything being tied to politics are simply not right. In this particular case, we anecdotally and empirically observe differences in how people behave within society (such as with reactions to scary objects/photographs), but I personally think that it is a stretch to apply those differences, which are lab-measured and cannot be done without expensive, sophisticated equipment, toward explaining politics and policy preferences.

### Application: Real-World Manifestations
In the course of searching "Prius or pickup" on Google (since it was a question/phrase that I had previously heard of in another context), I came across [an opinion article](https://www.suncoastnews.com/opinion/the-prius-or-pickup-test-flunks/article_444932d4-e2c6-11e8-92ac-a705d1972885.html) on a right- or centrist-leaning (?) local news site that responded directly to the publication of the Hetherington and Weiler book. While it is far from an academic perspective, and is outright dismissive about some elements of what one might consider progressive life (e.g. specialty drinks at Starbucks), it brings up some interesting points about how the dueling views of the world (preferring the status quo versus being open to change) can be more connected to one's place in society (i.e. age, job, background, income, physical location, etc.) than politics.

I personally see this manifested in the phenomenon of white blue-collar voters shifting from their support from Obama in the 2012 election to Trump in the 2016 election, which is discussed in a [2017 New York Times Upshot article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/upshot/the-obama-trump-voters-are-real-heres-what-they-think.html). In this case, the worldview construct falls apart: assuming that this group of voters did not all see dramatic changes in their personality in the four years between the 2012 and 2016 elections, and given that Obama and Clinton supported relatively similar policies (especially in comparison to the current Biden agenda), there should not be any reason why they switched their party preference for the presidency. (In fact, one might even argue that Obama was at a *dis*advantage among these voters relative to Clinton, especially if we are to assume -- and as Hetherington and Weiler suggest -- that these white, blue-collar voters have more "closed" personalities that make them resent people of other races.)
