## Week 6 Analysis: Gender and Worldview
*Tuesday, October 19, 2021*

This week, I take a closer look at how gender could influence a person's worldview -- and thus, political behavior. This seems like a natural extension of my [blog post from last week](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/2021/10/12/Week-Five-Blog-Post.html), which explored the idea of worldview in general and the notion that different people see the world differently. The idea that women have different worldviews than men on average is significant: for instance, [Barnhart et al. (2020)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/suffragist-peace/3FC70A0BE87859F624E42984BEB0322B) find that women prefer peaceful policies, which could have significant implications in the context of warfare and international relations.

### Gender and Worldview
Having already discussed the measurement mechanisms for worldview and political attitudes last week, I'll go directly into the **theory behind the proposed relationship between gender and political attitudes (or policy preferences), which involves the general idea that through either evolutionary or socialization mechanisms, women have come to see the world differently.** For instance, going back to my [Week 4 Post](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/2021/10/05/Week-Four-Blog-Post.html) on Social Dominance Theory, one explanation for gender differences is that throughout history, men have taken more dominant roles in society, leaving females to be less concerned about resource accumulation and acquiring political power. An alternative explanation is that females are being socialized in a way that is less conducive for them to develop an interest in the political realm, leading to less voluntary participation in societies where females are allowed to engage in politics. There is some evidence for these: for example, [Ross (2008](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27644501) finds that in the Middle East, female political socialization can occur at the workplace, such that countries with greater oil production (and thus fewer women in the workforce) have less of a female influence on politics. 

Of course, like the general idea of worldview that I discussed last week, all of this is occurring at the individual level. This is especially true for the socialization approach to explaining gender differences, which attributes the differences to small things, like the gender dynamics in one's own home or the environment that one faces at school. Thus, to actually have an impact on mass electoral politics (or masss politics, in countries that are not democratic), an additional assumption is required: that most individual females throughout society develop attitudes and preferences that are different from those of males, in effect multiplying the gender difference across the entire society. This is how individual-level, gender-based differences in worldview can affect societal-level politics and mass behavior.

### Implications of Gender Differences in Worldview
Now that I've covered some of the theoretical elements behind females having different worldviews and different political preferences, it's important to ask: why does this matter? **The idea that women have different worldviews from men (on average) is significant for a number of reasons, which can be categorized as representation, performance, or instrumental reasons.** First, representation is a key issue: if (democratic) governments are supposed to be for the people and by the people, then it would not make sense for country after country to have legislative decision-making bodies to be heavily composed of men. If women have worldviews that cause them to be disinterested in politics (either running for office or just voting in elections), then it might be hard to achieve representation. Second, performance is an important related factor: if female legislators and political leaders are better than male legislators at representing the interests of (most) women, then again, it would be both more efficient and normatively better for more women to be in office -- something that requires women to have a worldview that is amenable to seeking political power. Finally, instrumental reasons refer to policy outcomes assocaited with having more women in political office: for instance, as described in Barnhart et al. (2020), female legislators may be more likely to pursue policies of peace, leading to a less violent world. 

This is obviously an important conclusion, so to see if I can replicate the findings, I used a modified version of the data from Barnhart et al. (2020), which was provided in class (`suffrage_data.csv`). Using Polity scores, which are commonly used in political science as a measurement of how democratic or autocratic a country's institutions and governing authorities are, I first attempt to determine whether autocracies or democracies. Subsequently, I expanded the analysis to include 

### Discussion
Interestingly, the results were quite inconclusive and did not match up with what Carney et al. found. While they concluded that liberals score more highly on Openness than conservatives, and that conservatives score more highly on some sub-elements of Conscientiousness, **I found no statistically significant relationships whatsoever.** After running a series of multivariate linear regressions, with the Big Five dimensions (representing personality) as the explanatory variables and the political orientation (a proxy for worldview) as the outcome/dependent variable, I got the following results:

![OLS Regressions on Personality and Worldview](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/images/ols_regressions_personality_worldview.PNG)

As shown above, none of the estimated coefficients are statistically significant, even if we assume a rather lax `alpha = 0.10` significance level. This means that **we cannot rule out the possibility that none of the explanatory variables (i.e. none of the Big Five indicators of personality) actually have any impact on the outcome variable, a person's worldview,** since the lack of statistical significance means that the true coefficients might actually be zero. In fact, as shown above, the adjusted R-squared values for each of the three regressions (one for general political worldview, one for economic political worldview, and one for social political worldview) are actually negative, suggesting that the fitted models are worse than a horizontal line (which is the fourth model) for explaining the observed data.

However, running a linear regression with a discrete and categorical outcome variable can be problematic, because linear regression requires making an assumption that the true relationship between the explanatory variables and the outcome variable is linear -- and thus continuous. Thus, I experimented with a different model specification: I converted the general political worldview variable into a 0-or-1 binary variable, with two different coding methods (one labelling all `1`s and `2`s as liberals, and `3`s, `4`s, and `5`s as conservatives, while the other one differs by labeling `3`s as either liberal or conservative depending on the person's combined social and economic ideology scores). Now, the outcome variable, worldview, is binary, so I can run a logistic regression. The results are printed below in the first two columns; for greater transparency, I also included the corresponding linear reressions even though the linearity assumptions would clearly be violated.

### Application: Real-World Manifestations
In the course of searching "Prius or pickup" on Google (since it was a question/phrase that I had previously heard of in another context), I came across [an opinion article](https://www.suncoastnews.com/opinion/the-prius-or-pickup-test-flunks/article_444932d4-e2c6-11e8-92ac-a705d1972885.html) on a right- or centrist-leaning (?) local news site that responded directly to the publication of the Hetherington and Weiler book. While it is far from an academic perspective, and is outright dismissive about some elements of what one might consider progressive life (e.g. specialty drinks at Starbucks), it brings up some interesting points about how the dueling views of the world (preferring the status quo versus being open to change) can be more connected to one's place in society (i.e. age, job, background, income, physical location, etc.) than politics.

I personally see this manifested in the phenomenon of white blue-collar voters shifting from their support from Obama in the 2012 election to Trump in the 2016 election, which is discussed in a [2017 New York Times Upshot article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/upshot/the-obama-trump-voters-are-real-heres-what-they-think.html). In this case, the worldview construct falls apart: assuming that this group of voters did not all see dramatic changes in their personality in the four years between the 2012 and 2016 elections, and given that Obama and Clinton supported relatively similar policies (especially in comparison to the current Biden agenda), there should not be any reason why they switched their party preference for the presidency. (In fact, one might even argue that Obama was at a *dis*advantage among these voters relative to Clinton, especially if we are to assume -- and as Hetherington and Weiler suggest -- that these white, blue-collar voters have more "closed" personalities that make them resent people of other races.) In other words, this example makes me doubt the veracity of the claim that personality (at least, as measured by the methods that the authors propose) can help explain worldview in and of itself.
