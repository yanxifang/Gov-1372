## Week 7 Analysis: Symbolic Politics
*Tuesday, October 26, 2021*

This week, I take a closer look at the idea of "symbolic politics," which bears some resemblance to two concepts that I've explored in earlier weeks: [worldview](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/2021/10/12/Week-Five-Blog-Post.html) and [heuristics](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/2021/09/14/Week-One-Blog-Post.html). Since symbolic politics can have strong influences on individual-level political behavior, which includes things like riots and racialized policies (and thus, goes beyond just electoral politics), understanding the topic is important for explaining outcomes in both democratic and non-democratic countries.

### Symbolic Politics
The general idea of symbolic politics is that people use attitudes and predispositions gained early in life to evaluate and navigate complex political situations based on specific objects/actions that are directly associated with those situations. In this sense, symbolic politics is tied to the idea of heuristics: in both, decision-making is not necessarily rational or well thought-out, but instead, is more instinctive and relies on a person's perceptions or feelings toward one certain characteristic (or several characteristics) of the political object/event at hand.

Of course, these attitudes should take on certain characteristics, because not all attitudes developed early in life are necessarily going to influence a person's evaluation of political objects and actions. For example, the original iteration of an attitude that evolves over time would likely not be the only factor that a person considers in making a decision. Typically, these are the 3 criteria for an attitude or predisposition to be considered as influencing a person's symbolic attitudes:

- **Stability**: the attitude/predisposition remains similar for the same object over time.
- **Constraint**: the attitude/predisposition remains consistent among related objects (e.g. similar attitude toward similar objects, different attitude toward diametrically-opposed objects).
- **Power**: the attitude/predisposition has the strongest influence and "wins out" over other related attitudes/predispositions.

Without meeting these 3 criteria, it would be hard to see how one specific attitude would be able to shape one's political decision-making, especially for complex situations where a more thought-out process might be required before a decision is made. In this sense, symbolic politics is different from situational politics, a theory that would suggest that people evaluate political objects/actions comprehensively and on a case-by-case basis, even if their ultimate decision proves irrational. 

### Implications of Symbolic Politics
Symbolic politics matter because although the resulting political behavior will be at the individual level, that behavior can be easily scaled up if it turns out that many people have the same underlying predispositions and thus respond the same way to political events. One way in which symbolic politics can have a major impact is through violence, such as in the form of a riot or an otherwise destructive form of a political protest. For example, in 1965, the [Watts riot in Los Angeles](http://crdl.usg.edu/events/watts_riots/?Welcome) was a mass protest responding to the community's ongoing grievances and discontent that ultimately resulted in a significant amount of destruction and damage. Although there were some who argued that the participants were mostly African-Americans from the South, who had grown up under a very discriminatory system and thus resented the persistent societal inequalities, the most convincing data (which involved a team of researchers actually asking participants on the ground as the riots unfolded) shows that the participants most likely to engage in volence were actually socialized locally, where they were taught about principles like equality and thus were more frustrated about the conditions they were facing -- to the point that many of them were fine with participating in the destruction.



A paper that we read for class this week is [Reny and Newman (2021)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/opinionmobilizing-effect-of-social-protest-against-police-violence-evidence-from-the-2020-george-floyd-protests/C62FCC5556A43F0AE3CDA5EB6AFD3673)

### Implications of Gender Differences in Worldview
Now that I've covered some of the theoretical elements behind females having different worldviews and different political preferences, it's important to ask: why does this matter? **The idea that women have different worldviews from men (on average) is significant for a number of reasons, which can be categorized as representation, performance, or instrumental reasons.** First, representation is a key issue: if (democratic) governments are supposed to be for the people and by the people, then it would not make sense for country after country to have legislative decision-making bodies to be heavily composed of men. If women have worldviews that cause them to be disinterested in politics (either running for office or just voting in elections), then it might be hard to achieve representation. Second, performance is an important related factor: if female legislators and political leaders are better than male legislators at representing the interests of (most) women, then again, it would be both more efficient and normatively better for more women to be in office -- something that requires women to have a worldview that is amenable to seeking political power. Finally, instrumental reasons refer to policy outcomes assocaited with having more women in political office: for instance, as described in Barnhart et al. (2020), female legislators may be more likely to pursue policies of peace, leading to a less violent world. 

### Data Analysis & Interpretation
This is obviously an important conclusion, so to see if I can replicate the findings, I used a modified version of the data from Barnhart et al. (2020), which was provided in class (`suffrage_data.csv`). Using Polity scores, which are commonly used in political science as a measurement of how democratic or autocratic a country's institutions and governing authorities are, a binary (0 or 1) indicator of whether a country has suffrage for women, as well as information about how many (armed) conflicts a country initiates in a given year, I will test two things: whether democracies fight fewer wars than autocracies (since wars are costly, politicians in democracies are less likely to start them out of the fear that the public will disapprove), and whether having female suffrage leads to fewer wars.

After filtering the dataset to include only non-negative polity scores (since negative polity scores generally mean that a country's system of governance is not democratic), and I ran a linear regression with the following model: the number of initiated conflicts is the dependent variable, while the three independent variables are the country's polity score, the aforementioned binary indicator of whether a country has female suffrage, and an interaction term between suffrage and polity. The results are visualized below in the form of predictions:

![Police Unfavorability Over Time](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/images/police_unfavorability_time.png)

As shown above, **it does appear that female suffrage is predicted, on average, to reduce the number of conflicts that a country initiates, which supports the notion that when women actively participate in politics (or, at the very least, are given the chance to), the country's policies become more peaceful.** On the plot, the polity score is on the x-axis, with higher values representing a more democratic system of governance. The y-axis contains the number of initiated conflicts per year, with higher values representing more conflicts (and thus, a less peaceful set of policies). The plot on the left is for countries (and years) for which there isn't female suffrage, while the plot on the right is for countries (and years) for which there is female suffrage. Since the only difference between the two plots is whether there is female suffrage, the steeper (i.e. more negative) red line on the right suggests that female suffrage does reduce the number of conflicts, when holding other factors (here, only the polity score) constant. (Note: the dashed lines represent the upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval, and serve as a measure of uncertainty about our plot -- a plot of predicted values based off the regression model.)

Assuming that women in countries with female suffrage do actually take advantage of the opportunity to participate in politics, it is clear that the data is consistent with the notion that at the individual level, women prefer more peaceful policies for a variety of reasons (e.g. evolutionarily, women did not need to focus very much on material accumulation, something that is often achieved through physical conquest), leading to more peaceful policies when their preferences are multiplied and reflected at the mass-public level. Nonetheless, this data analysis is far from conclusive. For instance, the only variable being considered here is the Polity score, such that no other factors that could affect the dependent variable of conflicts -- such as a country's military capabilities (or possession of nuclear weapons), a country's economic standing, and country-specific factors like history or ethnic tensions with neighbors -- are included in the analysis, so it is plausible that when those variables are factored in, the results might be different. Similarly, the current analysis is based on an ssumption of linearity (that the relationship between polity and the number of conflicts will be a constant relationship regardless of the starting value ofthe polity score), which may not necessarily turn out to be the case. One additional consideration is that the analysis uses the number of initiated conflicts as a dependent variable, but a dependent variable that is interesting to consider would be whether a country started a conflict or not (i.e. a binary outcome variable, with 0 denoting no conflict and 1 denoting at least one initiated conflict).

### Extension: Binary Outcome for Conflict
To see how different the results might be if I switched to a binary outcome variable, I ran a second analysis. After modifying the data and running a parallel analysis, here's what I found:

![Polity Scores and Female Suffrage with Binary DV](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/images/polity_femalesuffrage_binary.png)

As shown above, **the same trend holds when we consider *whether* a country started a conflict instead of *how many* conflicts a country started. When holding the Polity score constant, having female suffrage leads to a lower probability of a country starting a conflict.** The fact that the conclusion remains the same when modifying how we code the information gives us more evidence to support the idea that gender-related differences in worldview can lead to substantively different policy outcomes, but as previously mentioned, this is still an analysis that is very limited in scope, and there are many other things that can (and should) be explored.

### Application: A Real-World Example?
An interesting anecdote that is consistent with what Barnhart et al. find is the case of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Having led Germany for 16 years, she has developed a reputation not only for taking a [consensus-based approach](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58597504) to domestic politics, but also serving as both a *de facto* [leader for the European Union](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/merkels-legacy-and-future-germany) and a [champion of liberal democracy](https://www.ft.com/content/653302ca-be3a-11e6-8b45-b8b81dd5d080), all of which are very cooperation-based, non-confrontational things -- and all of which could be considered to be diametrically opposed to warfare. This fits into the theory of female politicians and leaders being more pro-peace, but obviously, this is just an anecdote where `n = 1`, making it inappropriate to make any generalizations.
