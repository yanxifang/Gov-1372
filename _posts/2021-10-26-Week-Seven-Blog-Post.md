## Week 7 Analysis: Symbolic Politics
*Tuesday, October 26, 2021*

This week, I take a closer look at how gender could influence a person's worldview -- and thus, political behavior. This seems like a natural extension of my [blog post from last week](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/2021/10/12/Week-Five-Blog-Post.html), which explored the idea of worldview in general and the notion that different people see the world differently. The idea that women have different worldviews than men on average is significant: for instance, [Barnhart et al. (2020)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/suffragist-peace/3FC70A0BE87859F624E42984BEB0322B) find that women prefer peaceful policies, which could have significant implications in the context of warfare and international relations.

### Gender and Worldview
Having already discussed the measurement mechanisms for worldview and political attitudes last week, I'll go directly into the **theory behind the proposed relationship between gender and political attitudes (or policy preferences), which involves the general idea that through either evolutionary or socialization mechanisms, women have come to see the world differently.** For instance, going back to my [Week 4 Post](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/2021/10/05/Week-Four-Blog-Post.html) on Social Dominance Theory, one explanation for gender differences is that throughout history, men have taken more dominant roles in society, leaving females to be less concerned about resource accumulation and acquiring political power. An alternative explanation is that females are being socialized in a way that is less conducive for them to develop an interest in the political realm, leading to less voluntary participation in societies where females are allowed to engage in politics. There is some evidence for these: for example, [Ross (2008](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27644501) finds that in the Middle East, female political socialization can occur at the workplace, such that countries with greater oil production (and thus fewer women in the workforce) have less of a female influence on politics. 

Of course, like the general idea of worldview that I discussed last week, all of this is occurring at the individual level. This is especially true for the socialization approach to explaining gender differences, which attributes the differences to small things, like the gender dynamics in one's own home or the environment that one faces at school. Thus, to actually have an impact on mass electoral politics (or masss politics, in countries that are not democratic), an additional assumption is required: that most individual females throughout society develop attitudes and preferences that are different from those of males, in effect multiplying the gender difference across the entire society. This is how individual-level, gender-based differences in worldview can affect societal-level politics and mass behavior.

### Implications of Gender Differences in Worldview
Now that I've covered some of the theoretical elements behind females having different worldviews and different political preferences, it's important to ask: why does this matter? **The idea that women have different worldviews from men (on average) is significant for a number of reasons, which can be categorized as representation, performance, or instrumental reasons.** First, representation is a key issue: if (democratic) governments are supposed to be for the people and by the people, then it would not make sense for country after country to have legislative decision-making bodies to be heavily composed of men. If women have worldviews that cause them to be disinterested in politics (either running for office or just voting in elections), then it might be hard to achieve representation. Second, performance is an important related factor: if female legislators and political leaders are better than male legislators at representing the interests of (most) women, then again, it would be both more efficient and normatively better for more women to be in office -- something that requires women to have a worldview that is amenable to seeking political power. Finally, instrumental reasons refer to policy outcomes assocaited with having more women in political office: for instance, as described in Barnhart et al. (2020), female legislators may be more likely to pursue policies of peace, leading to a less violent world. 

### Data Analysis & Interpretation
This is obviously an important conclusion, so to see if I can replicate the findings, I used a modified version of the data from Barnhart et al. (2020), which was provided in class (`suffrage_data.csv`). Using Polity scores, which are commonly used in political science as a measurement of how democratic or autocratic a country's institutions and governing authorities are, a binary (0 or 1) indicator of whether a country has suffrage for women, as well as information about how many (armed) conflicts a country initiates in a given year, I will test two things: whether democracies fight fewer wars than autocracies (since wars are costly, politicians in democracies are less likely to start them out of the fear that the public will disapprove), and whether having female suffrage leads to fewer wars.

After filtering the dataset to include only non-negative polity scores (since negative polity scores generally mean that a country's system of governance is not democratic), and I ran a linear regression with the following model: the number of initiated conflicts is the dependent variable, while the three independent variables are the country's polity score, the aforementioned binary indicator of whether a country has female suffrage, and an interaction term between suffrage and polity. The results are visualized below in the form of predictions:

![Polity Scores and Female Suffrage](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/images/polity_femalesuffrage.png)

As shown above, **it does appear that female suffrage is predicted, on average, to reduce the number of conflicts that a country initiates, which supports the notion that when women actively participate in politics (or, at the very least, are given the chance to), the country's policies become more peaceful.** On the plot, the polity score is on the x-axis, with higher values representing a more democratic system of governance. The y-axis contains the number of initiated conflicts per year, with higher values representing more conflicts (and thus, a less peaceful set of policies). The plot on the left is for countries (and years) for which there isn't female suffrage, while the plot on the right is for countries (and years) for which there is female suffrage. Since the only difference between the two plots is whether there is female suffrage, the steeper (i.e. more negative) red line on the right suggests that female suffrage does reduce the number of conflicts, when holding other factors (here, only the polity score) constant. (Note: the dashed lines represent the upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval, and serve as a measure of uncertainty about our plot -- a plot of predicted values based off the regression model.)

Assuming that women in countries with female suffrage do actually take advantage of the opportunity to participate in politics, it is clear that the data is consistent with the notion that at the individual level, women prefer more peaceful policies for a variety of reasons (e.g. evolutionarily, women did not need to focus very much on material accumulation, something that is often achieved through physical conquest), leading to more peaceful policies when their preferences are multiplied and reflected at the mass-public level. Nonetheless, this data analysis is far from conclusive. For instance, the only variable being considered here is the Polity score, such that no other factors that could affect the dependent variable of conflicts -- such as a country's military capabilities (or possession of nuclear weapons), a country's economic standing, and country-specific factors like history or ethnic tensions with neighbors -- are included in the analysis, so it is plausible that when those variables are factored in, the results might be different. Similarly, the current analysis is based on an ssumption of linearity (that the relationship between polity and the number of conflicts will be a constant relationship regardless of the starting value ofthe polity score), which may not necessarily turn out to be the case. One additional consideration is that the analysis uses the number of initiated conflicts as a dependent variable, but a dependent variable that is interesting to consider would be whether a country started a conflict or not (i.e. a binary outcome variable, with 0 denoting no conflict and 1 denoting at least one initiated conflict).

### Extension: Binary Outcome for Conflict
To see how different the results might be if I switched to a binary outcome variable, I ran a second analysis. After modifying the data and running a parallel analysis, here's what I found:

![Polity Scores and Female Suffrage with Binary DV](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/images/polity_femalesuffrage_binary.png)

As shown above, **the same trend holds when we consider *whether* a country started a conflict instead of *how many* conflicts a country started. When holding the Polity score constant, having female suffrage leads to a lower probability of a country starting a conflict.** The fact that the conclusion remains the same when modifying how we code the information gives us more evidence to support the idea that gender-related differences in worldview can lead to substantively different policy outcomes, but as previously mentioned, this is still an analysis that is very limited in scope, and there are many other things that can (and should) be explored.

### Application: A Real-World Example?
An interesting anecdote that is consistent with what Barnhart et al. find is the case of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Having led Germany for 16 years, she has developed a reputation not only for taking a [consensus-based approach](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58597504) to domestic politics, but also serving as both a *de facto* [leader for the European Union](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/merkels-legacy-and-future-germany) and a [champion of liberal democracy](https://www.ft.com/content/653302ca-be3a-11e6-8b45-b8b81dd5d080), all of which are very cooperation-based, non-confrontational things -- and all of which could be considered to be diametrically opposed to warfare. This fits into the theory of female politicians and leaders being more pro-peace, but obviously, this is just an anecdote where `n = 1`, making it inappropriate to make any generalizations.
