## Week 8 Analysis: Intergroup Contact
*Tuesday, November 2, 2021*

This week, I examine the implications of intergroup contact, a concept that is centered around the idea that differences in how frequently members of different groups interact with each other can affect the relationship between those groups, and among other things, can potentially change the level of acceptance and tolerance between those groups.

### Intergroup Contact
The general idea of intergroup contact (and specifically, *positive* intergroup contact) is that when people interact more frequently with members of out-groups, those interactions can lead to greater trust and reduce conflict with the aforementioned outgroups. Such positive intergroup contact would occur under certain circumstances: as defined by Gordon Allport in his work *The Nature of Prejudice*, these conditions are: (a) the interaction is one in which the individuals from different groups are equals, (b) there is a common/shared purpose between the individuals from different groups, and (c) there is some type of institutional support for (or some authority that brought about) that intergroup interaction. When these conditions are met, Allport suggests that rather than the prevailing notion that interactions between different groups could lead to conflict, the result could actually be improved intergroup contact.

A prominent example of potentially positive intergroup contact is the military, at least in the context of the United States and the associated racial tensions. The military, at least today, puts individuals from different backgrounds and ethnic groups into the same roles and same ranks (thus fulfilling Allport's equality condition), and of course, there is a strong common goal (of protecting the United States) in addition to ongoing institutional support for that intergroup contact (at least in the sense that the military prohibits discrimination and does not run segregated units today).

**This is important for diverse, democratic societies like the United States because rather than the inevitable conflict between different groups that has traditionally been viewed as the end result, the theory of positive intergroup contact suggests that under the right conditions, greater tolerance and acceptance can actually become reality.** Thus, there are two implications that, at least partly, hinge on the theory of intergroup contact: the first is whether diverse societies will inevitably self-destruct due to internal division, and the second is the set of conditions under which 

### Measuring the Results of Intergroup Contact
Symbolic politics matter because although the resulting political behavior will be at the individual level, that behavior can be easily scaled up if it turns out that many people have the same underlying predispositions and thus respond the same way to political events. One way in which symbolic politics can have a major impact is through violence, such as in the form of a riot or an otherwise destructive form of a political protest. For example, in 1965, the [Watts riot in Los Angeles](http://crdl.usg.edu/events/watts_riots/?Welcome) was a mass protest, sparked by the arrest of a motorist, and responding to the community's ongoing grievances and discontent overall, that ultimately resulted in a significant amount of destruction and damage. Although there were some who argued that the participants were mostly African-Americans from the South, who had grown up under a very discriminatory system and thus resented the persistent societal inequalities, the most convincing data (which involved a team of researchers actually asking participants on the ground as the riots unfolded) shows that the participants most likely to engage in volence were actually socialized locally, where they were taught about principles like equality and thus were more frustrated about the conditions they were facing -- to the point that many of them were fine with participating in the destruction.

In other words, **symbolic politics can go a long way, especially when many people share the same influential predispositions and end up responding the same way to a political impetus** -- such as the motorist's arrest leading directly to the high level of mass participation in the Watts riot. This also means that symbolic politics affect not only democracies, but autocracies as well: popular mobilization is always a threat to regimes that are not democratic (an example is [Gary King's work on Chinese censorship](https://gking.harvard.edu/publications/how-censorship-china-allows-government-criticism-silences-collective-expression), which appears to target collective action more than it does politically-sensitive topics). In turn, this has implications for how people are (or should be) socialized, since it is very clear that the seemingly innocent process of socialization can have dramatic impacts later on.

### Application: Symbolic Politics and the 2020 Racial Justice Protests
An interesting and recent application of symbolic politics is covered in a paper that we read for class this week: [Reny and Newman (2021)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/opinionmobilizing-effect-of-social-protest-against-police-violence-evidence-from-the-2020-george-floyd-protests/C62FCC5556A43F0AE3CDA5EB6AFD3673) focus on the American population's reactions to the George Floyd racial justice protests in 2020. This study was very much a "natural experiment": data was already available about Americans' attitudes toward police, and the fact that the protests happened would allow for an examination of how those attitudes changed. The degree to which these attitudes change, as well as the rate at which the attitudes return to the pre-protest levels, might serve as indicators of how strongly-held the attitudes are -- and thus, might allow us to see more clearly whether Americans have predispositions toward institutions like the police (and what those predispositions are).

Using the in-class dataset (`RN_2001_data.Rds`), which was adapted from the Reny and Newman data, I analyzed some of the predictors of (individual-level) attitudes toward police, which Reny and Newman measured on a 1-to-4 scale (with 4 being the most unfavorable attitudes toward police). These predictors included the typical demographic variables (race, age, household income, level of education, party identification), as well as whether the response was given before or after the protests. As usual, I ran several models, and the results are printed below:

- A linear model with only two predictors: party identification, which was on a 1-to-7 scale with 7 being a "Strong Republican", and the pre-/post-protest binary indicator variable.
- A logistic model with all of the predictors that I've listed above. The outcome variable was converted to a binary one, with "Strongly Unfavorable" views of the police being coded as a `1` and all other attitudes being coded as a `0`.
- An ordered probit model with all of the predictors that I've listed above, which is a better model than linear because the ordered probit model is specifically designed for outcome variables that are ordered and can only take on integer values (such as the 1-to-4 scale of police favorability).

Since the three models are different in either the outcome variable or the predictor variables used, it's not useful to compare the magnitude of the coefficients. However, it's useful to note that all coefficients across the three models are statistically significant, and that each variable's estimated coefficient has the same sign (positive or negative) across the three models. Since higher values of the outcome variable (even for the binary outcome in model 2) suggest a more negative view toward the police, the models clearly show that either being non-white or answering after the protests had occurred is predicted to, by itself, lead to a less favorable view of the police when holding other predictors constant. Meanwhile, being Hispanic, being more right on the left-right spectrum, being older, being college-educated, or having a higher household income are each predicted to, by themselves, lead to a more favorable view of the police, when holding other predictors constant. The only things that are surprising here is that being Hispanic or being college-educated are more likely to lead to more favorable views of police, since the current political discourse suggests that both Hispanics and college-educated individuals are highly supportive of Democrats, who, in turn, are highly supportive of the protests and not so supportive of the police.

### Extension: Partial Replication
However, analyzing which characteristics might make a respondent have a more or less favorable attitude toward the police does not directly touch upon the concept of symbolic politics. Thus, as an extension, I attempted to replicate part of the visual findings from Reny and Newman (specifically, the upper-left plot in Figure 3), which might be more indicative of symbolic politics.

The plot below shows the per-day average of all respondents in terms of how favorably they viewed the police. Before the George Floyd protests, it is clear that the attitudes toward police were generally flat, centering around `2.0` on a day-to-day basis (which corresponds to a "Somewhat Favorable" attitude). Although this jumped up quite a bit in the immediate aftermath of the protests, indicating a drop in favorability (since higher values mean that the police are seen as less favorable), there is a relatively sharp downward trend, indicating that attitudes toward police were relatively quick to recover, and in fact, it appears that within the span of about 110 days, the attitudes toward police would have returned to the pre-protest normal. Since 110 days is less than 4 months, a relatively short period of time given the large and nationwide scale of the protests (and the fact that police-involved shootings did not stop in the interim), this might be evidence that as a country, attitudes toward police might be symbolic in the sense that on average, Americans somehow associate police with some other characteristic (perhaps order or safety) toward which they have a strong and consistent attitude. In other words, **the rapidity with which public attitudes about the police returned to normal after the Floyd protests could be indicative of relatively neutral (not pro-, but also not anti-, police sentiments in the US).**

### Discussion
It is certainly fascinating that there is strong evidence to support the idea that some attitudes, pre-conditioned during an individual's formative years, could have significant impacts on (political) behavior later in life. Since the "formative years" can be broadly defined (and indeed, in the case of the Watts riots, education played an important role in shaping attidudes), there are strong policy implications that one might conclude. For instance, one could make the argument that education -- or at least public education -- should be as disengaged from politics as possible, such that attitudes about political objects and events are not "mass-produced" and are more unique based on one's individual background and family. This is especially true if the goal in a democracy is to not only find consensus among a diverse group of people, but also to foster the conditions that allow for that diversity in the first place. Another policy implication relates to the idea of anti-bias trainings and the idea that going through such sessions would lead to dramatic changes in the workplace or an education environment: if people's attitudes are really so engrained and difficult to change, then it is unclear whether such trainings would actually have positive impacts beyond the short term. Of course, these are just theoretical examples of what someone could argue, and there is still a lot that we do not know about which specific attitudes are malleable and why.
