## Week 8 Analysis: Intergroup Contact
*Tuesday, November 2, 2021*

This week, I examine the implications of intergroup contact, a concept that is centered around the idea that differences in how frequently members of different groups interact with each other can affect the relationship between those groups, and among other things, can potentially change the level of acceptance and tolerance between those groups.

### Intergroup Contact
The general idea of intergroup contact (and specifically, *positive* intergroup contact) is that when people interact more frequently with members of out-groups, those interactions can lead to greater trust and reduce conflict with the aforementioned outgroups. Such positive intergroup contact would occur under certain circumstances: as defined by Gordon Allport in his work *The Nature of Prejudice*, these conditions are: (a) the interaction is one in which the individuals from different groups are equals, (b) there is a common/shared purpose between the individuals from different groups, and (c) there is some type of institutional support for (or some authority that brought about) that intergroup interaction. When these conditions are met, Allport suggests that rather than the prevailing notion that interactions between different groups could lead to conflict, the result could actually be improved intergroup contact.

A prominent example of potentially positive intergroup contact is the military, at least in the context of the United States and the associated racial tensions. The military, at least today, puts individuals from different backgrounds and ethnic groups into the same roles and same ranks (thus fulfilling Allport's equality condition), and of course, there is a strong common goal (of protecting the United States) in addition to ongoing institutional support for that intergroup contact (at least in the sense that the military prohibits discrimination and does not run segregated units today).

**This is important for diverse, democratic societies like the United States because rather than the inevitable conflict between different groups that has traditionally been viewed as the end result, the theory of positive intergroup contact suggests that under the right conditions, greater tolerance and acceptance can actually become reality.** In other words, there are two major implications that (at least partly) hinge on the theory of intergroup contact: the first is whether diverse societies will inevitably self-destruct due to internal division, and the second is the process of understanding the set of conditions under which positive intergroup contact can be achieved -- such that those conditions can be put in place to begin with.

### Measuring the Results of Intergroup Contact
To demonstrate the impacts of intergroup contact, it is intuitively necessary to measure people's attitudes before and after they interact with members of the other group. However, there are many unknowns in this proposed strategy: what exactly should be measured before and after? How long should the interaction be? Should the interaction be one-time or should it be repeated? And, perhaps most importantly, where should this be measured, in society or as part of a laboratory experiment -- in which case, the results might not be generalizable to other situations and contexts?

One approach to measuring intergroup contact is measuring affect -- something that is done by asking survey respondents about their attitudes toward another group (or their own group) on a number of scales (e.g. a negative-to-positive scale, a cool-to-warm scale, a loathing-to-admiration scale, and a contempt-to-respect scale). This can be done as part of a before-and-after type of experiment, where the same questions are asked twice to each respondent (at the beginning and end of the experiment), or alternatively, as part of a conditioning type experiment, where respondents are asked to think about different things (based on whether they are in the treatment or control group) and then asked to respond to those questions. The latter is done by [Wang et al. (2021)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022002720942824), which studied the impact on Chinese students of imagined/hypothetical social contact with Japanese people, and specifically, the impact on the Chinese students' attitudes toward the Japanese. Of course, this is a rather limited experiment in the sense that it is purely hypotthetical; other scholars have worked on trying to use experiments in real life to simulate the outcomes to the greatest possible extent. These include [Brown et al. (2021)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe8432), which studies geography and how exposure to diverse neighbors at a young age can change political behavior among white Americans, as well as [Mousa (2020)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abb3153), which focused specifically on the very different context of Christian and Muslim soccer players in Iraq.

### Application: Harvard Students and Imagined Contact with Members of the Opposite Party
An experimental structure similar to what Wang et al. (2021) used was applied to our class, and instead of measuirng attitudes toward Japanese people, the quantity of interest being measured was attitudes toward members of the out-party (mostly the Republican Party, since the overwhelming majority of Harvard students are very liberal.) Everything else was similar: respondents were randomly assigned to the treatment or control groups, with the control group being given a hypothetical situation of a bus ride with beautiful scenery, and the treatment group being given a hypothetical situation of a bus ride next to a member of the out-party; affective feelings were then collected. The resulting data is found in the file `Oct28ClassData.csv`.

To analyze the results, I ran several linear regressions. Across all of them, the `AffectDiff_avg` variable (the average difference in affective feelings between the in- and out-parties) was the dependent variable, and at the very least, the `Treated` variable (indicating whether the respondent was in the treatment or control group) was used as the independent variable. The models I ran are as follows:

- A linear model with only one predictor: `Treated`.
- A linear model with two predictors: `Treated` and `ClosestParty` (an indicator of which of the two major US political parties the respondent feels closer to). This regression might allow us to see if imagined intergroup contact has a larger effect on Democrats or on Republicans (or whether the effect is similar on members of either party).
- A linear model with two predictors: `Treated` and `strongPARTISAN` (an indciator of whether the respondent is a strong partisan of the party that they identify closest with). This regression might allow us to see whether imagined intergroup contact has a larger effect on strong or weak partisans in terms of changing their views toward the out-party.
- A linear model with various demographic predictors: `Treated`, `gender`, `college_stats` (whether the respondent has taken a college-level statistics course), `year` (year in college), and `US` (whether the respondent was born in the US). Similarly, this might allow us to see whether there are differences in how the treatment affects different demographic groups.
- A combined linear model with all of the variables listed above: `Treated`, `ClosestParty`, `strongPARTISAN`, `gender`, `college_stats`, `year`, and `US`.

Since the three models are different in either the outcome variable or the predictor variables used, it's not useful to compare the magnitude of the coefficients. However, it's useful to note that all coefficients across the three models are statistically significant, and that each variable's estimated coefficient has the same sign (positive or negative) across the three models. Since higher values of the outcome variable (even for the binary outcome in model 2) suggest a more negative view toward the police, the models clearly show that either being non-white or answering after the protests had occurred is predicted to, by itself, lead to a less favorable view of the police when holding other predictors constant. Meanwhile, being Hispanic, being more right on the left-right spectrum, being older, being college-educated, or having a higher household income are each predicted to, by themselves, lead to a more favorable view of the police, when holding other predictors constant. The only things that are surprising here is that being Hispanic or being college-educated are more likely to lead to more favorable views of police, since the current political discourse suggests that both Hispanics and college-educated individuals are highly supportive of Democrats, who, in turn, are highly supportive of the protests and not so supportive of the police.

### Extension: Partial Replication
However, analyzing which characteristics might make a respondent have a more or less favorable attitude toward the police does not directly touch upon the concept of symbolic politics. Thus, as an extension, I attempted to replicate part of the visual findings from Reny and Newman (specifically, the upper-left plot in Figure 3), which might be more indicative of symbolic politics.

The plot below shows the per-day average of all respondents in terms of how favorably they viewed the police. Before the George Floyd protests, it is clear that the attitudes toward police were generally flat, centering around `2.0` on a day-to-day basis (which corresponds to a "Somewhat Favorable" attitude). Although this jumped up quite a bit in the immediate aftermath of the protests, indicating a drop in favorability (since higher values mean that the police are seen as less favorable), there is a relatively sharp downward trend, indicating that attitudes toward police were relatively quick to recover, and in fact, it appears that within the span of about 110 days, the attitudes toward police would have returned to the pre-protest normal. Since 110 days is less than 4 months, a relatively short period of time given the large and nationwide scale of the protests (and the fact that police-involved shootings did not stop in the interim), this might be evidence that as a country, attitudes toward police might be symbolic in the sense that on average, Americans somehow associate police with some other characteristic (perhaps order or safety) toward which they have a strong and consistent attitude. In other words, **the rapidity with which public attitudes about the police returned to normal after the Floyd protests could be indicative of relatively neutral (not pro-, but also not anti-, police sentiments in the US).**

### Discussion
It is certainly fascinating that there is strong evidence to support the idea that some attitudes, pre-conditioned during an individual's formative years, could have significant impacts on (political) behavior later in life. Since the "formative years" can be broadly defined (and indeed, in the case of the Watts riots, education played an important role in shaping attidudes), there are strong policy implications that one might conclude. For instance, one could make the argument that education -- or at least public education -- should be as disengaged from politics as possible, such that attitudes about political objects and events are not "mass-produced" and are more unique based on one's individual background and family. This is especially true if the goal in a democracy is to not only find consensus among a diverse group of people, but also to foster the conditions that allow for that diversity in the first place. Another policy implication relates to the idea of anti-bias trainings and the idea that going through such sessions would lead to dramatic changes in the workplace or an education environment: if people's attitudes are really so engrained and difficult to change, then it is unclear whether such trainings would actually have positive impacts beyond the short term. Of course, these are just theoretical examples of what someone could argue, and there is still a lot that we do not know about which specific attitudes are malleable and why.
