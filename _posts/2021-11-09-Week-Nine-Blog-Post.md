## Week 9 Analysis: Emotion
*Tuesday, November 9, 2021*

This week, I consider the implications of human emotion on politics, and especially the role that emotion can play in creating anxiety and motivating individuals to search for more information about a political topic. 

### Emotion and Politics
Emotion has historically played an interesting role in politics. Dating back to the Enlightenment, when various elements of democracy were being rolled out in Western Europe, there has been discussion about the role of emotion in public policy: for instance, Madison's *Federalist Papers 49* argued that the "passions" of the public should be "controlled and regulated" by the government for the best possible outcomes, such that only the "reason" of the public is actually contributing to the democratic process. In this sense, even based on intuition alone, it seems clear that emotionally-afflicted publics will not be able to make the best decisions for themselves, since emotion can distort one's thinking and lead to favoring one thing over another even when all the evidence might point in the opposite direction.

From a more modern-day psychological perspective, emotion is very much an evolved trait that has evolutionary advantages. For instance, emotion can typically be measured on two dimensions: pleasure and arousal. When something is low in pleasure and high in arousal (e.g. a predator), humans use emotion to intuitively defend themselves; on the other end, when something is high in pleasure and high in arousal (e.g. something very enjoyable), the emotion is markedly different and one's guard is let down. This process is part of humans' surveillance system, which converts what one perceives through the five senses into emotion. Subsequently, the emotion translates into behavior, which may include things like finding more information or changing one's vote for a candidate/party that is perceived to be (un)pleasant.

### Measuring the Results of Intergroup Contact
To demonstrate the impacts of intergroup contact, it is intuitively necessary to measure people's attitudes before and after they interact with members of the other group. However, there are many unknowns in this proposed strategy: what exactly should be measured before and after? How long should the interaction be? Should the interaction be one-time or should it be repeated? And, perhaps most importantly, where should this be measured, in society or as part of a laboratory experiment -- in which case, the results might not be generalizable to other situations and contexts?

One approach to measuring intergroup contact is measuring affect -- something that is done by asking survey respondents about their attitudes toward another group (or their own group) on a number of scales (e.g. a negative-to-positive scale, a cool-to-warm scale, a loathing-to-admiration scale, and a contempt-to-respect scale). This can be done as part of a before-and-after type of experiment, where the same questions are asked twice to each respondent (at the beginning and end of the experiment), or alternatively, as part of a conditioning type experiment, where respondents are asked to think about different things (based on whether they are in the treatment or control group) and then asked to respond to those questions. The latter is done by [Wang et al. (2021)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022002720942824), which studied the impact on Chinese students of imagined/hypothetical social contact with Japanese people, and specifically, the impact on the Chinese students' attitudes toward the Japanese. Of course, this is a rather limited experiment in the sense that it is purely hypotthetical; other scholars have worked on trying to use experiments in real life to simulate the outcomes to the greatest possible extent. These include [Brown et al. (2021)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe8432), which studies geography and how exposure to diverse neighbors at a young age can change political behavior among white Americans, as well as [Mousa (2020)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abb3153), which focused specifically on the very different context of Christian and Muslim soccer players in Iraq.

### Application: Harvard Students and Imagined Contact with Members of the Opposite Party
An experimental structure similar to what Wang et al. (2021) used was applied to our class, and instead of measuirng attitudes toward Japanese people, the quantity of interest being measured was attitudes toward members of the out-party (mostly the Republican Party, since the overwhelming majority of Harvard students are very liberal.) Everything else was similar: respondents were randomly assigned to the treatment or control groups, with the control group being given a hypothetical situation of a bus ride with beautiful scenery, and the treatment group being given a hypothetical situation of a bus ride next to a member of the out-party; affective feelings were then collected. The resulting data is found in the file `Oct28ClassData.csv`.

To analyze the results, I ran several linear regressions. Across all of them, the `AffectDiff_avg` variable (the average difference in affective feelings between the in- and out-parties) was the dependent variable, and at the very least, the `Treated` variable (indicating whether the respondent was in the treatment or control group) was used as the independent variable. The models I ran are as follows:

- A linear model with only one predictor: `Treated`.
- A linear model with two predictors: `Treated` and `ClosestParty` (an indicator of which of the two major US political parties the respondent feels closer to). This regression might allow us to see if imagined intergroup contact has a larger effect on Democrats or on Republicans (or whether the effect is similar on members of either party).
- A linear model with two predictors: `Treated` and `strongPARTISAN` (an indciator of whether the respondent is a strong partisan of the party that they identify closest with). This regression might allow us to see whether imagined intergroup contact has a larger effect on strong or weak partisans in terms of changing their views toward the out-party.
- A linear model with various demographic predictors: `Treated`, `gender`, `college_stats` (whether the respondent has taken a college-level statistics course), `year` (year in college), and `US` (whether the respondent was born in the US). Similarly, this might allow us to see whether there are differences in how the treatment affects different demographic groups.
- A combined linear model with all of the variables listed above: `Treated`, `ClosestParty`, `strongPARTISAN`, `gender`, `college_stats`, `year`, and `US`.

The results are printed below:

The five models have the same outcome variable, so it is possible to compare them. As shown, apart from the constant, only one variable, `strongPARTISAN`, has a coefficient that is consistently statistically significant (the other variable with a statistically significant coefficient is `year`, but this is only for the model without `strongPARTISAN` included). The coefficient on `strongPARTISAN` is statistically significant and positive, and because the outcome variable is `AffectDiff_avg`, the difference in affect scores, it is clear that regardless of whether there is an imagined interaction, respondents who identify strongly with one of the two parties are likely to have a larger gap in affect toward members of the two parties, which isn't much of a surprise because intuitively, partisans are stronger believers in their party and are less likely to be openly tolerant toward those who are of the other party.

In addition, the fact that `Treated` does not have a statistically significant coefficient shows that among Harvard students (or at least the Harvard students taking Political Psychology), the prospect of engaging with a member of the out-party is not predicted to lead to a change in how they view the out-party in general, since the model suggests that *not* engaging with a member of the out-party would lead to similar outcomes. This is interesting because it shows that the theory of positive intergroup contact does not seem to apply to Harvard students here, although again, the caveat is that Gov 1372 students may not be representative of the entire undergraduate population, and similarly, imagined social contact -- imagined only for a short period of time -- is proabbly different from actual contact, both of which potentially make the results not so generalizable.

These results, combined, are interesting because they show several things. First, Harvard students (or Harvard Government department students, or Harvard Gov 1372 students only) seem to be very stubborn and fixed in their perception of the out-party, not changing their thoughts (either positively or negatively) as a result of being asked to think about interacting with a member of the out-party. On the one hand, it's good that the result isn't negative (since that would foreshadow elevated tensions and conflict in the future), but on the other hand, it is inconsistent with the idea of positive intergroup contact. Second, there is a notable and quite significant difference in Harvard students' views toward their own party versus the opposing major party. All of the affective scores (which contribute to the outcome variable in the model) are out of 7, and through the coefficients, each model shows that there is a difference of at least `2` points on average. This would likely explain the relative intolerance of conservative viewpoints on campus (among other things), since the liberal-leaning students simply favor their own party, the Democratic Party, much more. Finally, the results are interesting in that being a Republican, or being a woman, or being someone who took a statistics course (and is potentially more rationally-minded) or being born outside the United States (when holding all other variables constant) doesn't really change the gap between affect for one's own group and affect for the other party. This could be evidence of hyper-partisanship at Harvard, which is potentially problematic because it foreshadows future intergroup conflict at the university level (not unlike ongoing China-Japan cultural tensions, which largely lie outside the realm of great-power competition).

### Discussion
In addition to the implications highlighted above, I think a central question to ask here is: does the experience of being students at Harvard meet the necessary conditions that Allport had mentioned for positive intergroup contact: equality, shared purpose, and institutional support? My answer is that the experience does *not* meet any of those requirements. For instance, while Harvard promotes equality with its financial aid program (allowing low- and middle-income students to attend), its single dining plan for undergraduates (making the dining halls shared spaces), and its current random house-sorting mechanisms (limiting concentrations of students from either high or low socioeconomic backgrounds within certain residential houses, which had been an issue in the past), there is still a significant amount of inequality in the types of extracurricular activities that students participate in (e.g. finals clubs versus term-time jobs, as an extreme example) or even in the types of things that students worry about (e.g. which Harvard Square restaurant to try next, versus family members at home who rely on the student for various porposes). Similarly, there is not a shared purpose: different students have different post-undergraduate expectations and aspirations, and are looking to get different things out of the academic programs that they pursue. Finally, there is no formal/strong institutional support: while some administrator probably hopes for mingling among students with very different political orientations, it is obviously not enforced. In light of this, it would make sense that Harvard students -- or at least Gov 1372 students -- don't really show evidence of positive intergroup contact, at least not in the imagined context.

Zooming out to the bigger picture, I think the idea that intergroup contact can promote better relations between groups is certainly an optimistic one, even though there is definitely evidence to support it. The fact that it requires so many conditions -- most of which are not met in the real world -- makes the notion somewhat unrealistic, and even if we were able to identify the necessary conditions, they would be hard to impose on a democratic society where individual freedom is valued and institutional coercion is highly frowned upon. In other words, while better relations can probably be formed in settings like the military, it might be unrealistic to expect strongly positive intergroup contact on a societal level.
