## Week 9 Analysis: Emotion
*Tuesday, November 9, 2021*

This week, I consider the implications of human emotion on politics, and especially the role that emotion can play in creating anxiety and motivating individuals to search for more information about a political topic. 

### Emotion and Politics
Emotion has historically played an interesting role in politics. Dating back to the Enlightenment, when various elements of democracy were being rolled out in Western Europe, there has been discussion about the role of emotion in public policy: for instance, Madison's *Federalist Papers 49* argued that the "passions" of the public should be "controlled and regulated" by the government for the best possible outcomes, such that only the "reason" of the public is actually contributing to the democratic process. In this sense, even based on intuition alone, it seems clear that emotionally-afflicted publics will not be able to make the best decisions for themselves, since emotion can distort one's thinking and lead to favoring one thing over another even when all the evidence might point in the opposite direction.

From a more modern-day psychological perspective, emotion is very much an evolved trait that has evolutionary advantages. For instance, emotion can typically be measured on two dimensions: pleasure and arousal. When something is low in pleasure and high in arousal (e.g. a predator), humans use emotion to intuitively defend themselves; on the other end, when something is high in pleasure and high in arousal (e.g. something very enjoyable), the emotion is markedly different and one's guard is let down. This process is part of humans' surveillance system, which converts what one perceives through the five senses into emotion. Subsequently, the emotion translates into behavior, which may include things like finding more information or changing one's vote for a candidate/party that is perceived to be (un)pleasant.

One proposed hypothesis for how emotion directly influences politics is as follows: there is strong evidence to suggest that economic performance is quite predictive of election outcomes for the incumbent party. But how does the economy directly affect individuals' vote choices? This can be explained with emotion: when people see poor economic performance, they get emotional about not having enough money in their wallets/pocketbooks/bank accounts, , and when they see excellent economic performance, they also get emotional, but in a happy/pleasant way. Thus, the emotion leads to a response rooted in evolution: the negative emotion leads to anxiety about the incumbent party (and presumably, its leaders and/or policy platforms), so they vote for the alternative. Thus, in this proposed hypothesis, emotion is the mechanism linking the economy to election outcomes. Of course, this is just a hypothesis; an alternative hypothesis could have the economy contributing directly to changes in emotion *and* the vote, in which case, emotion would still exist, but it just wouldn't be linked to the political quantity of interest -- election outcomes -- directly.

### Observing and Quantifying Emotional Responses
For class, we examined data collected as part of an experimental study [(Clifford and Jerit 2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12350) on emotion, and specifically, the emotion of disgust. Using an experimental design that asks respondents about their perspective after being given information about one of four different iterations of a hypothetical outbreak of an infectious diseases, the study collects information on what pieces of information were accurately remembered, what each respondent felt in terms of disgust and anxiety, whether the respondent expressed an interest in learning more, as well as basic demographic information. This was followed by a second part, which showed various unpleasant (but real) images of a disease, and asked about how respondents felt about those, whether the amount of retained information was different/distorted, and whether they would search for more information as a result of seeing the images, among other things.

This experimental design has its advantages. In asking about something that was rather hypothetical at the time, the questions were able to indirectly gauge how people would react to similar societal issues (such as political issues) without actually asking directly about politics. This is helpful because a survey centered around a political issue would inevitably get distorted by respondents' existing feelings about that issue, thus making the results less generalizable to other situations. Another advantage is that multiple questions are used to gauge responses like anxiety and disgust: since emotions are inherently difficult to quantify, asking people about similar feelings can lead to results that can be tested for internal consistency, but also average out any potential issues with people feeling that one adjective is less strong/accurate of a word to describe their reaction. At the same time, the multiple questions still don't capture everything that we might want to know, and this is inevitably an issue with survey/experimental research: there is only so much funding available for a project, and only so many questions researchers can ask in a survey before respondents get disinterested and start answering without putting the same amount of thought into their answers.

For this blog post, I focused primarily on the results of the first experiment; the data is named `Study1ReplicationData.dta`. This contains information about the treatment that the respondent received in the "news" article about the infectious disease, the responses to three questions measuring disgust (disgust, how grossed out someone is, and how repulsed someone is), three questions measuring anxiety (afraid, anxious, worried), as well as various other pieces of information. Here, the primary variable of interest would be those disgust and anxiety indices: after all, our goal is to understand how emotion affects politics.

### Evaluating Emotional Responses

- A linear model with only one predictor: `Treated`.
- A linear model with two predictors: `Treated` and `ClosestParty` (an indicator of which of the two major US political parties the respondent feels closer to). This regression might allow us to see if imagined intergroup contact has a larger effect on Democrats or on Republicans (or whether the effect is similar on members of either party).
- A linear model with two predictors: `Treated` and `strongPARTISAN` (an indciator of whether the respondent is a strong partisan of the party that they identify closest with). This regression might allow us to see whether imagined intergroup contact has a larger effect on strong or weak partisans in terms of changing their views toward the out-party.
- A linear model with various demographic predictors: `Treated`, `gender`, `college_stats` (whether the respondent has taken a college-level statistics course), `year` (year in college), and `US` (whether the respondent was born in the US). Similarly, this might allow us to see whether there are differences in how the treatment affects different demographic groups.
- A combined linear model with all of the variables listed above: `Treated`, `ClosestParty`, `strongPARTISAN`, `gender`, `college_stats`, `year`, and `US`.

### Discussion
In addition to the implications highlighted above, I think a central question to ask here is: does the experience of being students at Harvard meet the necessary conditions that Allport had mentioned for positive intergroup contact: equality, shared purpose, and institutional support? My answer is that the experience does *not* meet any of those requirements. For instance, while Harvard promotes equality with its financial aid program (allowing low- and middle-income students to attend), its single dining plan for undergraduates (making the dining halls shared spaces), and its current random house-sorting mechanisms (limiting concentrations of students from either high or low socioeconomic backgrounds within certain residential houses, which had been an issue in the past), there is still a significant amount of inequality in the types of extracurricular activities that students participate in (e.g. finals clubs versus term-time jobs, as an extreme example) or even in the types of things that students worry about (e.g. which Harvard Square restaurant to try next, versus family members at home who rely on the student for various porposes). Similarly, there is not a shared purpose: different students have different post-undergraduate expectations and aspirations, and are looking to get different things out of the academic programs that they pursue. Finally, there is no formal/strong institutional support: while some administrator probably hopes for mingling among students with very different political orientations, it is obviously not enforced. In light of this, it would make sense that Harvard students -- or at least Gov 1372 students -- don't really show evidence of positive intergroup contact, at least not in the imagined context.

Zooming out to the bigger picture, I think the idea that intergroup contact can promote better relations between groups is certainly an optimistic one, even though there is definitely evidence to support it. The fact that it requires so many conditions -- most of which are not met in the real world -- makes the notion somewhat unrealistic, and even if we were able to identify the necessary conditions, they would be hard to impose on a democratic society where individual freedom is valued and institutional coercion is highly frowned upon. In other words, while better relations can probably be formed in settings like the military, it might be unrealistic to expect strongly positive intergroup contact on a societal level.
