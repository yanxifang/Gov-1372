## Week 10 Analysis: Context and Behavior
*Tuesday, November 16, 2021*

This week, I assess the role of contextual influence on political behavior, and use the specific example of the 2019 Harvard admissions ruling to assess the various potential channels through which the events that a person (or the general public) is exposed to can influence changes in political attitudes and behavior. 

### Contextual Influences
Humans' experiences can shape a lot of their behavior. At the individual level, for instance, daily interactions with members of a group can shape and evolve one's feelings toward that group by building greater familiarity, which is something that I explored in [Week 8](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/2021/11/02/Week-Eight-Blog-Post.html). On a broader societal level, though, that level of regularity simply doesn't exist for everyone, pushing us to consider a different type of experience: contextual/situational experiences, which can be defined as relatively fleeting and short-lived experiences that might affect someone's behavior, at least temporarily.

The general idea behind contextual experiences is that although the experience might be short in duration, there can be an immediate/short-term change in the person's attitudes and behavior. This is tested by [Melissa Sands (2017)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26479037) as part of an experiment: her team placed actors of various races, some of whom were dressed as if they were poor and some as if they were rich, on a street in a wealthy Boston neighborhood, and then various survey-takers would ask passers-by to sign a petition for greater wealth redistribution through a "millionaires' tax." While this might seem strange, she found that passers-by who saw the "poor" actor were less supportive of wealth redistribution (with those who saw the "rich" actor being more supportive), which is consistent with the theory of contextual influence: when people saw a person poorer than themselves, they presumably felt wealthy in relative terms and became afraid that the redistribution would involve taking money away from them. The reverse can be said for people seeing the "rich" actor: they presumably felt less wealthy in comparison and were more supportive of redistribution, since it could benefit them. While this experiment is merely consistent with the theory and does not prove it by any means, it still shows the substantive explanatory power of the theory and allows us to move forward with the assumption that the thetory has held true in at least one real-world scenario. (There is also observational -- as opposed to experimental -- evidence that is consistent with the theory: for instance, [Berger et al. (2008)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25462880) show that voting in a school building, which is something that is assigned by the municipal authorities and is not the voter's choice, is associated with greater support for education-related questions on the ballot. The theory in this observational study is that being physically inside the school reminds a voter about the education system and/or children, making them more likely to be in favor of pro-school policies.)

In terms of psychology, context influences human behavior through three main channels:
- Rational choice: the experience changes the "calculus" of the situation, such that it makes sense to change one's behavior for rational reasons (e.g. new information learned from the experience means that the old behavior plan is no longer advantageous). 
- Priming: the experience changes how much emphasis a person places on something. This is based on the theory of associative networks, in which various ideas and objects are interconnected with each other; the experience makes some of those links more important, allowing the person to value other links less as they make a behavioral decision.
- Emotion: the experience changes a person's feelings toward something. This is based on the theory that rational-choice is not a good explanation for human behavior, since humans can be capricious and change their mind often. 

All three of these channels are important because they speak to the possibility that a person can change their behavior in the short term (i.e. humans do not require a long time before changing their behavior). All three are consistent with [Philip Converse (1964)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08913810608443650), who shows, through empirical studies, that people don't have coherent worldviews and don't have stable preferences on policies -- thus leaving open the possibility that changes in behavior are possible and likely.

### Modeling the Research Process with Contextual Influences
For class this week, we modeled the research process, using contextual influences as the generic topic of interest. Using the [Nationscape Data Set](https://www.voterstudygroup.org/data/nationscape), I went through the various steps of the process, from finding a "motivating event" upon which to build the study to generating a hypothesis to conducting data analysis to making a conclusion about the hypothesis. For the rest of this blog post, I will be briefly describing what I did, and how the results connect to the general theory of contextual influence.

The Nationscape Data Set contains a plethora of American political attitude information collected through extensive survey efforts in 2019 and 2020, which placed a time constraint on the motivating events that I could have chosen for the analysis. In light of this, I chose to focus on the [October 1, 2019 federal district court ruling that upheld Harvard's affirmative action admissions policies](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/01/730386096/federal-judge-rules-in-favor-of-harvard-in-admissions-case), which was very much an expected outcome at the time but nonetheless generated much conversation on the national stage about the role of race in not only college admissions, but also employment and other educational contexts. As shown below, there was a marked increase in interest around the beginning of October 2019, at least according to Google Trends:

Since my research involved the theory of contextual influence, I had to build a hypothesis based on what I thought the ruling's impact might be on the American public. I came uup with the following: the Harvard admissions ruling, which is inevitably linked to race, increases the salience of race and racial attitudes among Americans, causing a shift in attitudes toward minority groups and/or the white population. This hypothesis relies on the priming channel, since it assumes that with the ruling being somewhat fresh in people's minds, it would cause them to base their attitudes toward other racial groups more on the ruling than on other factors (e.g. past interactions with members of other racial groups), leading to a change in overall attitudes. After receiving some peer feedback, I was made aware that the study design may not be ideal: for instance, if Americans in certain racial groups changed their racial attitudes in one direction while those in other racial groups changed their attitudes in opposite direction, the net effect might be close to zero, masking the conclusion. (In response, I decided to add confounding variables, such as the respondent's own racial group, to the operationalized version of the analysis.)

Next, I operationalized my hypothesis. I decided to choose the following four variables as the outcome variables, since each of these can feasibly be used as proxies for racial attitudes in general toward minority groups (especially Black Americans, who are most often seen as being the primary beneficiaries of affirmative action policies).
- `racial_attitudes_tryhard`: this was a question on the survey that alluded to other minority groups overcoming prejudice and working their way up in American society, and asked whether Black Americans should do the same "without any special favors". A higher value represents stronger disagreement with the notion that Black Americans should do the same "without any special favors".
- `discrimination_blacks`: this was a question on the survey that asks about the level of discrimination today against Black Americans. A higher value represents less discrimination.
- `discrimination_whites`: this was a question on the survey that asks about the level of discrimination today against white Americans. A higher value represents less discrimination.
- `group_favorability_blacks`: this was a question that asked about how favorable a respondent's impression of the Black community is. A higher value represents lower favorability.

After defining these variables, I did a bit of data cleaning and performed a series of initial analyses, looking at the difference in means for each of the four variables from before and after the "treatment" (the October 1, 2019 ruling). I found that three of the four variables did not have statistically significant differences between the pre- and post-treatment means, and the one that did -- `discrimination_blacks` -- did not have a high Cohen's D score (which is used to gauge the effect size of the treatment), suggesting that the treatment did not have particularly notable impacts on any of the four variables. The results are printed below:

| Variable | Estimated Difference in Means | P-Value | Cohen's D | Cohen's D Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `racial_attitudes_tryhard` | 0.0498 | 0.2126 | -0.0369 | Negligible | 
| `discrimination_blacks` | -0.1262 | 0.0003 | 0.1057 | Negligible | 
| `discrimination_whites` | 0.0705 | 0.0571 | -0.0561 | Negligible | 
| `group_favorability_blacks` | 0.0371 | 0.1586 | -0.443 | Negligible | 

At least with this test, my hypothesis has fallen short. The lack of an impact suggests that the ruling didn't have much of an impact on Americans' racial attitudes as a whole, which is not consistent with my hypothesis that racial attitudes would change due to greater salience. Thus, I moved on to a second test: running multiple linear regression and including a number of covariates to account for any existing differences, say, between members of different racial groups. The covariates included the typical demographic variables (e.g. race, education, household income, party identification, ideological beliefs), as well as a variable called `reparations`, which was from a question asking whether reparations should be given to the descendants of slaves (higher values signal disagreement with reparations). I included this last one due to the controversial nature of reparations: given how much political disagreement there is, it seems reasonable to assume that one's view on this issue is strongly correlated with one's racial attitudes (at least attitudes toward Black Americans), which makes it a powerful confounding variable. Of course, the primary explanatory variable is the `treated` variable, which would indicate whether or not there was a notable change in the outcome before and after the October 1 ruling.

The results from running the four multiple linear regression models are displayed below:

![Model for Racial Attitudes and Harvard Case](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/images/harvard_admissions_model.PNG)

As shown above, my variable of interest (`treated`) is not statistically significant across all four models. Again, my hypothesis has fallen short, because these results suggest that the ruling itself didn't have much of an impact on Americans' racial attitudes when accounting for basic demographic factors like race and income (as well as one's support for reparations). Instead, it appears that the confounding variables are better at explaining differences in the outcome variables, particularly the reparations variable, ideology, and some levels of the party variable (which I converted into a factor for the purposes of the regression). This marks the end of the research modeling: I didn't find evidence to support my hypothesis, so it's time to generate a different hypothesis and start over again...

### Discussion: Contextual Influences
While my iteration of the research process didn't find evidence of the October 2019 court ruling as having any impact on American racial attitudes, I am still convinced that the theory holds value for understanding politics. For instance, I found the Berger et al. (2008) research particularly convincing: with school polling sites being (pseudo-)randomly assigned to voters, there doesn't seem to be much of an explanation for the higher support for school funding at those specific precincts, other than the fact that the voters are physically present in a school when casting their ballots. In light of these two seemingly contradictory assertions, I think my personal conclusion is that the theory of contextual influence is not universal, but rather, needs some conditions to be satisfied for it to work. For instance, the context needs to be immediately accessible to the person being influenced. In the Harvard admissions case, it is far from clear that Americans in general, the vast majority of whom do not pay very much attention to politics, would have neecssarily even heard about the ruling, much less its implications for race-conscious decisions made elsewhere in society; in contrast, the school environment is something that each voter can directly and easily observe. In any case, it would be interesting to see what other types of real-world experiments (similar to Sands') could feasibly be implemented to further test this theory, since it can have lots of implications for
