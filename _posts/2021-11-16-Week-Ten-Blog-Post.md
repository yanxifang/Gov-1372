## Week 10 Analysis: Context and Behavior
*Tuesday, November 16, 2021*

This week, I assess the role of contextual influence on political behavior, and use the specific example of the 2019 Harvard admissions ruling to assess the various potential channels through which the events that a person (or the general public) is exposed to can influence changes in political attitudes and behavior. 

### Contextual Influences
Humans' experiences can shape a lot of their behavior. At the individual level, for instance, daily interactions with members of a group can shape and evolve one's feelings toward that group by building greater familiarity, which is something that I explored in [Week 8](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/2021/11/02/Week-Eight-Blog-Post.html). On a broader societal level, though, that level of regularity simply doesn't exist for everyone, pushing us to consider a different type of experience: contextual/situational experiences, which can be defined as relatively fleeting and short-lived experiences that might affect someone's behavior, at least temporarily.

The general idea behind contextual experiences is that although the experience might be short in duration, there can be an immediate/short-term change in the person's attitudes and behavior. This is tested by [Melissa Sands (2017)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26479037) as part of an experiment: her team placed actors of various races, some of whom were dressed as if they were poor and some as if they were rich, on a street in a wealthy Boston neighborhood, and then various survey-takers would ask passers-by to sign a petition for greater wealth redistribution through a "millionaires' tax." While this might seem strange, she found that passers-by who saw the "poor" actor were less supportive of wealth redistribution (with those who saw the "rich" actor being more supportive), which is consistent with the theory of contextual influence: when people saw a person poorer than themselves, they presumably felt wealthy in relative terms and became afraid that the redistribution would involve taking money away from them. The reverse can be said for people seeing the "rich" actor: they presumably felt less wealthy in comparison and were more supportive of redistribution, since it could benefit them. While this experiment is merely consistent with the theory and does not prove it by any means, it still shows the substantive explanatory power of the theory and allows us to move forward with the assumption that the thetory has held true in at least one real-world scenario. (There is also observational -- as opposed to experimental -- evidence that is consistent with the theory: for instance, [Berger et al. (2008)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25462880) show that voting in a school building, which is something that is assigned by the municipal authorities and is not the voter's choice, is associated with greater support for education-related questions on the ballot. The theory in this observational study is that being physically inside the school reminds a voter about the education system and/or children, making them more likely to be in favor of pro-school policies.)

In terms of psychology, context influences human behavior through three main channels:
- Rational choice: the experience changes the "calculus" of the situation, such that it makes sense to change one's behavior for rational reasons (e.g. new information learned from the experience means that the old behavior plan is no longer advantageous). 
- Priming: the experience changes how much emphasis a person places on something. This is based on the theory of associative networks, in which various ideas and objects are interconnected with each other; the experience makes some of those links more important, allowing the person to value other links less as they make a behavioral decision.
- Emotion: the experience changes a person's feelings toward something. This is based on the theory that rational-choice is not a good explanation for human behavior, since humans can be capricious and change their mind often. 

All three of these channels are important because they speak to the possibility that a person can change their behavior in the short term (i.e. humans do not require a long time before changing their behavior). All three are consistent with [Philip Converse (1964)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08913810608443650), who shows, through empirical studies, that people don't have coherent worldviews and don't have stable preferences on policies -- thus leaving open the possibility that changes in behavior are possible and likely.

### Modeling the Research Process with Contextual Influences
For class this week, we modeled the research process, using contextual influences as the generic topic of interest. Using the [Nationscape Data Set](https://www.voterstudygroup.org/data/nationscape), I went through the various steps of the process, from finding a "motivating event" upon which to build the study to generating a hypothesis to conducting data analysis to making a conclusion about the hypothesis. For the rest of this blog post, I will be briefly describing what I did, and how the results connect to the general theory of contextual influence.

The Nationscape Data Set contains a plethora of American political attitude information collected through extensive survey efforts in 2019 and 2020, which placed a time constraint on the motivating events that I could have chosen for the analysis. In light of this, I chose to focus on the [October 1, 2019 federal district court ruling that upheld Harvard's affirmative action admissions policies](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/01/730386096/federal-judge-rules-in-favor-of-harvard-in-admissions-case), which was very much an expected outcome at the time but nonetheless generated much conversation on the national stage about the role of race in not only college admissions, but also employment and other educational contexts. As shown below, there was a marked increase in interest around the beginning of October 2019, at least according to Google Trends:

Since my research involved the theory of contextual influence, I had to build a hypothesis based on what I thought the ruling's impact might be on the American public. I came uup with the following: the Harvard admissions ruling, which is inevitably linked to race, increases the salience of race and racial attitudes among Americans, causing a shift in attitudes toward minority groups and/or the white population. This hypothesis relies on the priming channel, since it assumes that with the ruling being somewhat fresh in people's minds, it would cause them to base their attitudes toward other racial groups more on the ruling than on other factors (e.g. past interactions with members of other racial groups), leading to a change in overall attitudes. After receiving some peer feedback, I was made aware that the study design may not be ideal: for instance, if Americans in certain racial groups changed their racial attitudes in one direction while those in other racial groups changed their attitudes in opposite direction, the net effect might be close to zero, masking the conclusion. (In response, I decided to add confounding variables, such as the respondent's own racial group, to the operationalized version of the analysis.)

Next, I operationalized my hypothesis. I decided to choose the following four variables as the outcome variables, since each of these can feasibly be used as proxies for racial attitudes in general toward minority groups (especially Black Americans, who are most often seen as being the primary beneficiaries of affirmative action policies).
- `racial_attitudes_tryhard`: this was a question on the survey that alluded to other minority groups overcoming prejudice and working their way up in American society, and asked whether Black Americans should do the same "without any special favors". A higher value represents stronger disagreement with the notion that Black Americans should do the same "without any special favors".
- `discrimination_blacks`: this was a question on the survey that asks about the level of discrimination today against Black Americans. A higher value represents less discrimination.
- `discrimination_whites`: this was a question on the survey that asks about the level of discrimination today against white Americans. A higher value represents less discrimination.
- `group_favorability_blacks`: this was a question that asked about how favorable a respondent's impression of the Black community is. A higher value represents lower favorability.

### Evaluating Emotional Responses
I ended up regressing two very different multivariate models to gauge the role of emotion in politics, based on the Clifford and Jerit first-experiment data. The first model used the respondent's level of "disgust" as the outcome variable, while the second used the amount of time that the respondent spent on reading the initial article about the disease as the outcome variable. The following predictor/independent variables were used:

- `treat_rand1`: the respondent's treatment assignment. There were four groups: (1) was an article that was designed to be low in anxiety and disgust, (2) was an article high in anxiety but low in disgust, (3) was an article low in anxiety but high in disgust, and (4) was an article that was high in anxiety and disgust.
- `grossed_out` and `repulsed`: two separate feelings/variables that belong in the "disgust" index. These were only used for the second model due to concerns about multicollinearity with the first model's outcome variable, `disgust`. A higher value represents a stronger feeling of being grossed out or repulsed.
- `afraid`, `anxious`, `worried`: three separate feelings/variables that belong in the "anxiety" index. A higher value represents a stronger feeling of being afraid, anxious, or worried.
- `Q17_6`: the self-reported likelihood of the respondent looking for more information about the disease. A higher value means that the likelihood is higher.
- `Q17_7`: the self-reported likelihood of discussing the disease with friends and family soon. A higher value means that the likelihood is higher.
- `addl_info`: a binary variable (0 for no, 1 for yes) indicating whether the respondent requested to see more information about the disease.
- `race`, `gender`, `partyid`, `education`: these serve as control variables and are self-explanatory.

The reasoning behind the first model is to better understand what specific things might actually contribute to stronger emotions (or at least stronger disgust), which, under the theory that emotions lead to action, would then translate into a greater likelihood of someone changing their (political) behavior, such as at the voting booth. The second model is to better understand the motivations behind the search for information: the outcome variable -- the amount of time that someone spends reading the article -- should, at least in theory, be indicative of the person's desire to learn more about the issue at hand. This matters because thinking about politics, one might argue that politically-informed voters are better voters, especially if we accept the theory that reason among the public leads to the best outcomes in democratic societies.

A note here is that the second model could be seen as problematic, because the amount of time that someone spends is actually collected before any of the other data is collected in the experiment (i.e. each respondent reads the article first, before they actually answer any questions about their disgust). Thus, it may not necessarily be that people who feel more disgusted spend more/less time on reading their article; the relationship can go the other way, such that people feel more disgusted *because* they had spent more time scrutinizing every last detail of the article. However, I get around this problem because I am not trying to establish causality by any means; rather, I am simply looking for a correlation that would be consistent with intuition, which is something that can be measured even if the explanatory and outcome variables are switched.

The results of the two models are printed below in coefficient-plot form:


![Model for Racial Attitudes and Harvard Case](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/images/harvard_admissions_model.PNG)

As shown above, the first model (which had an R-squared value of `0.44`) had quite a few variables with statistically significant coefficients, while the second model (which actually had a slightly negative unadjusted R-squared value, and an adjusted value of less than 0.01) only had one: `grossed_out`. To interpret the first model: being more afraid, or more anxious, or more worried about the disease (all of which are part of the anxiety index) is predicted, on average, to increase how disgusted someone feels about the disease, as is a higher-numbered treatment (which generally reflects either a more anxiety-provoking treatment, a more disgust-provoking treatment, or both). This is quite consistent with what we might intuitively expect: anxiety is a key mechanism between a person's five senses and their (negative) emotions, so higher anxiety (as well as a treatment that is designed to provoke higher anxiety and/or higher disgust) would have been assumed to lead to more disgust in the first place. There weren't any particularly notable differences among those with different demographic backgrounds, although higher levels of education were likely to make someone feel less disgusted (which, again, is consistent with intuition because more education means that someone has been exposed to more knowledge -- presumably some scientific knowledge too, making them slightly more rational in terms of seeing the situation). To interpret the second model: only the `grossed_out` variable has a statistically significant coefficient, but even then, its confidence interval is *very* wide. This is likely because of the large range of the outcome variable (and high variance): as found in the data assignment, the variance was a whopping `187,679` for the amount of time that the respondents spent on the article (I suspect that some respondents walked away from their computer, while others didn't really pay attention -- but this is rather unfortunate, because it might indicate that the study's results might not be easily generalizable to either the real world or another substantive situation).

### Discussion
Substantively, the results tell us that being exposed to something that provokes greater anxiety might be linked with stronger emotions -- or at the very least, a stronger feeling of disgust. While this may seem mundane, it actually provides important connections to politics, since it seems to suggest that promoting greater anxiety, such as through negative election ads targeted at the opposing candidate, could possibly succeed in driving voters away from the targeted candidate. However, various questions remain. For instance, how long does this effect last? The experiment was conducted in a lab-type setting, and as far as I can tell, there was not follow-up in the study beyond the one-week period when respondents would be asked whether they discussed the article with people they knew, so it is unclear when the bulk of the anxiety goes away (or if it ever does, in the more extreme scenario. Similarly, does this apply differently to different political topics of interest? A public health situation is something that affects everyone (after all, infectious diseases don't tend to discriminate, as seen with COVID infections), so with issues like education (which elderly folks might not be as concerned about, especially if they live in a different state than their children and grandchildren) or even climate change (which is a rather distant phenomenon, particularly for lower-income folks trying to just get by), it's not immediately clear whether that anxiety would be present in the first place.

In any case, there are definitely some anecdotal cases of emotion playing a notable role in politics, so I can definitely see where the impetus for the research is coming from. For instance, the recent Virginia gubernatoral election featured, in its last month, a conversation about [whether parents should have a say in their children's education](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/05/mcauliffes-quote-schools-was-clunker-polls-suggest-parental-backlash-didnt-swing-election/), which inevitably provoked anxiety because (at least some) parents were concerned about not being able to have a voice in what their children should be learning in schools. That same election also featured a suspicious setup where [hired actors were brought in to pose as tiki torch-carrying white supremists supporting Glenn Youngkin](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/10/29/lincoln-project-torches-charlottesville-youngkin/), no doubt another example of provoking anxiety -- and thus backlash --
against the then-Republican candidate among racial minorities who would be reasonably worried about the rise of such blatantly racist and xenophobic groups. Of course, there are also the political messages in the 2020 election cycle: in addition to the persistent Democratic warning about the risks of having Trump as president for four more years, a particularly notable example was the Senate Democrats' warning that the confirmation of now-Justice Amy Coney Barrett would mean the death of Roe v. Wade -- again, an anxiety-provoking statement meant to change people's emotions and thus behavior. Given all of this, I think there's a strong argument to be made about the role of emotions, but unfortunately, emotion is hard to quantify, complicating the process of rigorously testing the theory.
