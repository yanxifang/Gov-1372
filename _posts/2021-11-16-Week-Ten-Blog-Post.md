## Week 10 Analysis: Context and Behavior
*Tuesday, November 16, 2021*

This week, I assess the role of contextual influence on political behavior, and use the specific example of the 2019 Harvard admissions ruling to assess potential channels through which the events that a person (or the general public) is exposed to can influence changes in political attitudes and behavior. 

### Emotion and Politics
Emotion has historically played an interesting role in politics. Dating back to the Enlightenment, when various elements of democracy were being rolled out in Western Europe, there has been discussion about the role of emotion in public policy: for instance, Madison's *Federalist Papers 49* argued that the "passions" of the public should be "controlled and regulated" by the government for the best possible outcomes, such that only the "reason" of the public is actually contributing to the democratic process. In this sense, even based on intuition alone, it seems clear that emotionally-afflicted publics will not be able to make the best decisions for themselves, since emotion can distort one's thinking and lead to favoring one thing over another even when all the evidence might point in the opposite direction.

From a more modern-day psychological perspective, emotion is very much an evolved trait that has evolutionary advantages. For instance, emotion can typically be measured on two dimensions: pleasure and arousal. When something is low in pleasure and high in arousal (e.g. a predator), humans use emotion to intuitively defend themselves; on the other end, when something is high in pleasure and high in arousal (e.g. something very enjoyable), the emotion is markedly different and one's guard is let down. This process is part of humans' surveillance system, which converts what one perceives through the five senses into emotion. Subsequently, the emotion translates into behavior, which may include things like finding more information or changing one's vote for a candidate/party that is perceived to be (un)pleasant.

One proposed hypothesis for how emotion directly influences politics is as follows: there is strong evidence to suggest that economic performance is quite predictive of election outcomes for the incumbent party. But how does the economy directly affect individuals' vote choices? This can be explained with emotion: when people see poor economic performance, they get emotional about not having enough money in their wallets/pocketbooks/bank accounts, , and when they see excellent economic performance, they also get emotional, but in a happy/pleasant way. Thus, the emotion leads to a response rooted in evolution: the negative emotion leads to anxiety about the incumbent party (and presumably, its leaders and/or policy platforms), so they vote for the alternative. Thus, in this proposed hypothesis, emotion is the mechanism linking the economy to election outcomes. Of course, this is just a hypothesis; an alternative hypothesis could have the economy contributing directly to changes in emotion *and* the vote, in which case, emotion would still exist, but it just wouldn't be linked to the political quantity of interest -- election outcomes -- directly.

### Observing and Quantifying Emotional Responses
For class, we examined data collected as part of an experimental study [(Clifford and Jerit 2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12350) on emotion, and specifically, the emotion of disgust. Using an experimental design that asks respondents about their perspective after being given information about one of four different iterations of a hypothetical outbreak of an infectious diseases, the study collects information on what pieces of information were accurately remembered, what each respondent felt in terms of disgust and anxiety, whether the respondent expressed an interest in learning more, as well as basic demographic information. This was followed by a second part, which showed various unpleasant (but real) images of a disease, and asked about how respondents felt about those, whether the amount of retained information was different/distorted, and whether they would search for more information as a result of seeing the images, among other things.

This experimental design has its advantages. In asking about something that was rather hypothetical at the time, the questions were able to indirectly gauge how people would react to similar societal issues (such as political issues) without actually asking directly about politics. This is helpful because a survey centered around a political issue would inevitably get distorted by respondents' existing feelings about that issue, thus making the results less generalizable to other situations. Another advantage is that multiple questions are used to gauge responses like anxiety and disgust: since emotions are inherently difficult to quantify, asking people about similar feelings can lead to results that can be tested for internal consistency, but also average out any potential issues with people feeling that one adjective is less strong/accurate of a word to describe their reaction. At the same time, the multiple questions still don't capture everything that we might want to know, and this is inevitably an issue with survey/experimental research: there is only so much funding available for a project, and only so many questions researchers can ask in a survey before respondents get disinterested and start answering without putting the same amount of thought into their answers.

For this blog post, I focused primarily on the results of the first experiment; the data is named `Study1ReplicationData.dta`. This contains information about the treatment that the respondent received in the "news" article about the infectious disease, the responses to three questions measuring disgust (disgust, how grossed out someone is, and how repulsed someone is), three questions measuring anxiety (afraid, anxious, worried), as well as various other pieces of information. Here, the primary variable of interest would be those disgust and anxiety indices: after all, our goal is to understand how emotion affects politics.

### Evaluating Emotional Responses
I ended up regressing two very different multivariate models to gauge the role of emotion in politics, based on the Clifford and Jerit first-experiment data. The first model used the respondent's level of "disgust" as the outcome variable, while the second used the amount of time that the respondent spent on reading the initial article about the disease as the outcome variable. The following predictor/independent variables were used:

- `treat_rand1`: the respondent's treatment assignment. There were four groups: (1) was an article that was designed to be low in anxiety and disgust, (2) was an article high in anxiety but low in disgust, (3) was an article low in anxiety but high in disgust, and (4) was an article that was high in anxiety and disgust.
- `grossed_out` and `repulsed`: two separate feelings/variables that belong in the "disgust" index. These were only used for the second model due to concerns about multicollinearity with the first model's outcome variable, `disgust`. A higher value represents a stronger feeling of being grossed out or repulsed.
- `afraid`, `anxious`, `worried`: three separate feelings/variables that belong in the "anxiety" index. A higher value represents a stronger feeling of being afraid, anxious, or worried.
- `Q17_6`: the self-reported likelihood of the respondent looking for more information about the disease. A higher value means that the likelihood is higher.
- `Q17_7`: the self-reported likelihood of discussing the disease with friends and family soon. A higher value means that the likelihood is higher.
- `addl_info`: a binary variable (0 for no, 1 for yes) indicating whether the respondent requested to see more information about the disease.
- `race`, `gender`, `partyid`, `education`: these serve as control variables and are self-explanatory.

The reasoning behind the first model is to better understand what specific things might actually contribute to stronger emotions (or at least stronger disgust), which, under the theory that emotions lead to action, would then translate into a greater likelihood of someone changing their (political) behavior, such as at the voting booth. The second model is to better understand the motivations behind the search for information: the outcome variable -- the amount of time that someone spends reading the article -- should, at least in theory, be indicative of the person's desire to learn more about the issue at hand. This matters because thinking about politics, one might argue that politically-informed voters are better voters, especially if we accept the theory that reason among the public leads to the best outcomes in democratic societies.

A note here is that the second model could be seen as problematic, because the amount of time that someone spends is actually collected before any of the other data is collected in the experiment (i.e. each respondent reads the article first, before they actually answer any questions about their disgust). Thus, it may not necessarily be that people who feel more disgusted spend more/less time on reading their article; the relationship can go the other way, such that people feel more disgusted *because* they had spent more time scrutinizing every last detail of the article. However, I get around this problem because I am not trying to establish causality by any means; rather, I am simply looking for a correlation that would be consistent with intuition, which is something that can be measured even if the explanatory and outcome variables are switched.

The results of the two models are printed below in coefficient-plot form:

![Model for Racial Attitudes and Harvard Case](https://yanxifang.github.io/Gov-1372/images/harvard_admissions_model.PNG)

As shown above, the first model (which had an R-squared value of `0.44`) had quite a few variables with statistically significant coefficients, while the second model (which actually had a slightly negative unadjusted R-squared value, and an adjusted value of less than 0.01) only had one: `grossed_out`. To interpret the first model: being more afraid, or more anxious, or more worried about the disease (all of which are part of the anxiety index) is predicted, on average, to increase how disgusted someone feels about the disease, as is a higher-numbered treatment (which generally reflects either a more anxiety-provoking treatment, a more disgust-provoking treatment, or both). This is quite consistent with what we might intuitively expect: anxiety is a key mechanism between a person's five senses and their (negative) emotions, so higher anxiety (as well as a treatment that is designed to provoke higher anxiety and/or higher disgust) would have been assumed to lead to more disgust in the first place. There weren't any particularly notable differences among those with different demographic backgrounds, although higher levels of education were likely to make someone feel less disgusted (which, again, is consistent with intuition because more education means that someone has been exposed to more knowledge -- presumably some scientific knowledge too, making them slightly more rational in terms of seeing the situation). To interpret the second model: only the `grossed_out` variable has a statistically significant coefficient, but even then, its confidence interval is *very* wide. This is likely because of the large range of the outcome variable (and high variance): as found in the data assignment, the variance was a whopping `187,679` for the amount of time that the respondents spent on the article (I suspect that some respondents walked away from their computer, while others didn't really pay attention -- but this is rather unfortunate, because it might indicate that the study's results might not be easily generalizable to either the real world or another substantive situation).

### Discussion
Substantively, the results tell us that being exposed to something that provokes greater anxiety might be linked with stronger emotions -- or at the very least, a stronger feeling of disgust. While this may seem mundane, it actually provides important connections to politics, since it seems to suggest that promoting greater anxiety, such as through negative election ads targeted at the opposing candidate, could possibly succeed in driving voters away from the targeted candidate. However, various questions remain. For instance, how long does this effect last? The experiment was conducted in a lab-type setting, and as far as I can tell, there was not follow-up in the study beyond the one-week period when respondents would be asked whether they discussed the article with people they knew, so it is unclear when the bulk of the anxiety goes away (or if it ever does, in the more extreme scenario. Similarly, does this apply differently to different political topics of interest? A public health situation is something that affects everyone (after all, infectious diseases don't tend to discriminate, as seen with COVID infections), so with issues like education (which elderly folks might not be as concerned about, especially if they live in a different state than their children and grandchildren) or even climate change (which is a rather distant phenomenon, particularly for lower-income folks trying to just get by), it's not immediately clear whether that anxiety would be present in the first place.

In any case, there are definitely some anecdotal cases of emotion playing a notable role in politics, so I can definitely see where the impetus for the research is coming from. For instance, the recent Virginia gubernatoral election featured, in its last month, a conversation about [whether parents should have a say in their children's education](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/05/mcauliffes-quote-schools-was-clunker-polls-suggest-parental-backlash-didnt-swing-election/), which inevitably provoked anxiety because (at least some) parents were concerned about not being able to have a voice in what their children should be learning in schools. That same election also featured a suspicious setup where [hired actors were brought in to pose as tiki torch-carrying white supremists supporting Glenn Youngkin](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/10/29/lincoln-project-torches-charlottesville-youngkin/), no doubt another example of provoking anxiety -- and thus backlash --
against the then-Republican candidate among racial minorities who would be reasonably worried about the rise of such blatantly racist and xenophobic groups. Of course, there are also the political messages in the 2020 election cycle: in addition to the persistent Democratic warning about the risks of having Trump as president for four more years, a particularly notable example was the Senate Democrats' warning that the confirmation of now-Justice Amy Coney Barrett would mean the death of Roe v. Wade -- again, an anxiety-provoking statement meant to change people's emotions and thus behavior. Given all of this, I think there's a strong argument to be made about the role of emotions, but unfortunately, emotion is hard to quantify, complicating the process of rigorously testing the theory.
