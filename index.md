Welcome to my blog for Government 1372 (Political Psychology) at Harvard University!

## Introduction
Hello! I'm Yanxi Fang, an undergraduate student at Harvard University majoring in Government with a minor in Economics. This blog presents my work for Gov 1372, a course that I am taking during the Fall 2021 semester. Over the course of the semester, I will be updating the blog every week with new data, models, analysis, and visualizations.
